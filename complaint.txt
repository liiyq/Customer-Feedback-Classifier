Have spent over 4 hours trying to purchase tickets on a @united MileagePlus Explorer card. On hold again. Thinking @SouthwestAir next time.
.@HeathrowAirport waiting on @united 97 from Houston #planespotting #travel http://t.co/VVcmIv4I88
As a 1K frequent flyer on @united I can honestly say I have never been more frustrated with this airline. Becoming worse by the day
For an industry that's in dire need of a business model shakeup. it's sad to see @JetBlue give up http://t.co/maqrRiLlUk
@AmericanAir mobile app update broke drop down menus to fill in country and state to complete check in. Help!
To the dipsh*t that decided to go to the bathroom on the runway &amp; delay my @JetBlue flight out of FLL even longer: I HATE YOU TO NO END
so @jetblue delays my flight to JFK which will make me miss @Fly_Norwegian to Sweden &amp; won't refund me any of my $$ #boycottjetblue #help
Of course @United connection wouldn't wait and instead left early despite multiple passengers being delayed bc of United. #theworst
@DeltaAssist it has been 30 working days since i sent my complaint and i have not heard anything back
@united delayed 6 times now...
@DeltaAssist Travelling from ORD to RNO. will miss connection in SLC. can you help me?
@AmericanAir once again terrible service on a flight - zone 5 boarding with an annual fee credit card unacceptable!!!!!
@united united airlines getting really worse .. Two major incidents of clear discrimination.. #Autism and recently #Muslim woman
@AmericanAir waiting in JFK for luggage for over an hour. Flight 290 from Austin. Was delayed 3 hours. Very poor service.
@DeltaAssist pay me back the suitcase you broke. give me compensation for the 3 days of worries I had on vacation.
@WeeklyChris im so sorry babe.ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜” @AmericanAir fuck you my baby needs service &amp; you're not doing shit about it.
@DeltaAssist delta flight 2317 DTW to LAS late boarding sitting on Tarmac for an hour very disappointing
It's awful that @JetBlue turns the #TV off to play an audio safety recording. They need a video like #Delta! #travel $JBLU
@AmericanAir currently waiting to board my connection. After being bumped off my previous flight with another carrier. #allgood
@SouthwestAir Been on hold three times. disconnected at 35 mins. flight cancelled and need refund. Please help.
@united never again... Flight was delayed 3 times. I get to my destination and you have neither of my bags. What a shit show of a company...
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to get a fee refund issue resolved for a past flight. Can I get a hand with that?
@united: Not letting families with little kids on your planes first is awful. Were you thinking that miserable kids make a better flight?
@DeltaAssist When you leave a loyal customer's bag in another state overnight. you should do more than email them the location of the bag.
@VirginAmerica any info re Americans stuck in #cabosanlucas #cabo #secretscabo ?? When will flights resume?
@SouthwestAir is really tickin me off these days.. I've been waiting on the phone for 32 min now.. Really..?
@mattfrieds They have had many of those opportunities. They manage to fail them all. @MikeWatersSYR @DonnaDitota1 @united
Never ever flying with @AmericanAir ever again! Double charged me for my flight which caused me to have an over draft fee. Ruined my vacay.
@VirginAtlantic no they weren't. the person i spoke to said they couldn't help. extremely annoyed being passed between @DeltaAssist and VA
@LaurynCwilliams how can u have travel patience when the airlines have no customer service or loyalty? @AirCanada @AmericanAir
United claims it was auxiliary power unit" issue! RT @tdknabe: @united 5 hrs to fly a mechanic in to do maintenance. http://t.co/ASLsuxqcJm
@DeltaAssist -my wife+son spent 24 hrs at LGA Apr13/14 -14 delays. 2 cancelled flights. unhelpful comm. Whatâ€™s our recourse? #deltadobetter
I'm so tired of @united airlines bad customer service. Looking to rebook our flights w @VirginAmerica - I just can't deal w United anymore.
I'm listening to drake because this @united flight delay has made me break up with my sanity
@united been waiting 6 hours on my lax-chi flight.... u guys are awful....get less terrible
@DeltaAssist  hold for 1 hr 7 minutes is miserable. anyway to have someone call me when avail?
Recent  @DeltaAssist experience has been less than    Stellar.  4 flights = 9 hours delay.  I live out west.  Weather not the problem
@JetBlue Very disappointed in jet blue getaways vacation team. I placed a vacation with them and was given a special of 50 dollars a day
@SouthwestAir unfortunately it's been broken from the get go :( and to top it off I'm out of drink coupons
@united Won't ever fly united again.  A dreadful experience from start to finish.  And I flew united A LOT. #AnyoneButUnited
@AlaskaAir why did my seats change. again!!!! I had 3 seats confirmed. checked in to find they were moved! What the heck?
@united Flight UA 229 is definitely delayed &amp; without an update on the app. it'll look like I missed my next flight on my own accord. Help?
@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
@AmericanAir I know you give a #shit about Your #customers but I still have to say that #AmericanAirlines #customerservice #sucks #bigtime !
@DeltaAssist Trying to book international flight but http://t.co/jToJFkjVPG having problems.
â€œ@JoeJONeill: I URGENTLY need to speak to @Delta they have lost 4 of our bags and without them we can't film this week!â€ @DeltaAssist
@DeltaAssist No. May be a problem with Delta Site and Safari. Seems to work on Chrome. Cleared cache. restarted Safari. No go.
@AmericanAir still no one here to work on the plane. Again still waiting crew member said no way the people are not here to even to fix it.
@united I've been waiting for my flight and you've delayed it numerous times...4hrs delay and your calling for a 6hr delay...unbelievable :(
Always a problem with @united
@AmericanAir been waiting 4 hours for a callback...trying to change my flight tomorrow from DCA-LIT.
@DeltaAssist Not sure why my miles have not posted from my flights on 4/27. Is there an IT issue with the delta app?
Why only one staffer at JFK Gate 3 w/ multiple canceled flights and wind issues @JetBlue? #flyingsolo #sendbackup
@SouthwestAir @JChoi182 how is that gonna fix his bad experience? Throw that boy a complimentary ticket and show him you're better
@JetBlue second time I've flown jet blue. Second time a 3 hour delay. Not weather. BAD AIRLINE!
@AmericanAir : Getting pax who are standing AT THE GATE onboard is more important than posting "on time" with a 30 min WX delay DFW1650 FAIL
@AmericanAir why has flight #1954 been "de-icing" for over an hour???  Crazy long. crazy bad
@AmericanAir I will NEVER fly with you again I would rather walk to Georgia I could probably get there faster anyways
@KLM by the way @deltaassist never replied to my tweet at all so all in all there__s still a lot of room for improvement
.@AmericanAir your planning. sense of time. logistics. customer service and the common sense of your employees is horrendous
@AmericanAir we have been on hold for 3.5 hours to change our flight that was cancelled in Chicago. Is anyone answering?  Please help !!!
IFE loaded for 13 hours in business class on @AmericanAir 187 this weekend. Never worked. http://t.co/jCU6L5UKIK
@aayoub @dancohen3000 @Delta @DeltaAssist this is awful.
@SouthwestAir I'm rolling into hour 2 on hold. Seriously. Just need to change a flight your site isn't allowing me to. Anybody home?
@DeltaAssist What's up with the length of time it's taking to reach a representative tonight? I've been on hold for over 20 minutes already.
@JetBlue can I tell you how jealous I am about missing #FlyFiTweet-palooza???  Looks like you guys had a blast
@AmericanAir Sitting on the DFW tarmac for 1.5 hours. trying to get a gate. Get it together. this is getting stupid
This sickens me. http://t.co/5JFPKm837F via @theregoesbabs @united. your response was lame. Results. Not excuses. Policy changes needed.
Waiting for @SouthwestAir to find a pilot?? Flight has already been delayed due to weather for 2.5 hours. #haveyouseenourpilot #SW682
@DeltaAssist is the worst airline around i see why i only fly @southwest yall need to learn from them
I was on hold with @united #UnitedAirlines and after waiting 90 minutes I gave up !  #CostumerServiceâ€¦ http://t.co/9ISCo0vVcU
@JensenAckles @AlaskaAir @jarpad seriously? that kinda sucks. i like that things happen to you guys too..but. seriously? that'd piss me off
@AmericanAir I went to check in for my flight this morning and it says it's been cancelled. I received no notice of any problems!
@AmericanAir not choosing this airline again. employees were rude and @camerondallas has missed his flight but you decide to ignore him.
@united service sucks we paid for better seats and we got shitty ones they always overbook and are not accommodating
@VirginAmerica smells like U are piping vaporized alcohol through the air vents. New #CDC disinfectant rules? :-) #DoctorOfficeSmell #NotBad
@DeltaAssist can someone please help me change a flight. Just passed an hour on hold.
@SouthwestAir flt4472 SLCtoLAS 2/7/15 delayed  "mechanical" issues for 2 hours 50min.  5  time changes. nothing offered by gate .missed work
@DeltaAssist - can you please help find the lost bags from the fco flight that was a code share with Alitalia? #aznocustomerservice
Barely made my @AlaskaAir flight. Texted at 545 to say 740 flight was delayed to 11. Got to PDX at 915 to find it changed w/o notice to 10.
@JetBlue snack boxes. Not meals. The flight is longer than ones that offer real food.
Hey @united get some more baggage handlers at Terminal C at Newark Liberty Airport - people have been waiting hours! http://t.co/2GNf4WCcKy
@tobiasbuckell @united Can you upgrade to better "on hold" music? #AskingForAFriend
@AmericanAir oh yea...business class from SFO 2 JFK makes the new smell even better :)
@AmericanAir It is way past time to post a travel notice for @BOS and northeast. Who makes this decision? Why the delay? It's school vacay!
Oh hi @SouthwestAir! What's up with ur wifi? I paid &amp; it's a fail. Took 3 hrs to send this tweet. This girl's got work to do! Refund plz.
@AmericanAir still waiting for a response. Last contact you requested i resubmit Death Certificate but no one died #shocked#confused

Early flight means rough plane clean up night before still no tv @JetBlue http://t.co/XKZRoFlBHa
Complete debacle at @AmericanAir in MIA. And staff is as rude as they could be. Hundreds in line. #nightmare #fail
â€œ@PartyThieves: Nvm @united. This 6hr flight to Seattle is going to be terrible... Where's the leg space?." @TheChainsmokers said it first.
@AmericanAir is the worst airline I've ever dealt with. Your employees are the rudest. you are unhelpful and its going to take me almost
Stuck in MIA for 7 hours because @AmericanAir bumped me off a flight that never should have been touched :(
We wait at the gate for way too long while they do paperwork manually because some computer system is down. Brittle systems @united @flySFO
@AmericanAir 1 poor customer service person working while 300 wait for a chance at a discounted hotel. http://t.co/VjDItqxirs
@united back at the gate and we're delayed again - another mechanical - an hour and a half and looking at a missed connection! Consistency!
â€œ@JoeJONeill: OI @DeltaAssist HELP WE ARE MISSING 4 @TheVampsband BAGS!!!!â€ Shit
@AmericanAir Miss Baheith who works at check in at american is such a bitch! #horriblecustomerservice im sorry I was such an inconvenience.

@JetBlue Had $280 RT tickets in my cart and then the site timed out.  Now they're no longer available.  Any way to recover?
Geez @JetBlue Only an airline could announce that bags are no longer free and 15 more seats will be crammed in and call it a "cabin refresh"
@JetBlue I'm trying to figure out if my flight purchase was successful! Just waited on hold but was cut off! Please help!
@united and now you leave my luggage in iha...you really need to think about your custumer service!
@AmericanAir diverted to Austin. missed connecting flight in Dallas. Still on Tarmac HELP

@united what is with this bullshit bag size check that is causing huge delays @ ohare?

@beachrunn: Frustrated with@americanair flt cancelled sun - now pilot forgot to do his job equals missed connection home grrrrrr
@AlaskaAir flight #626 to Las Vegas. attendant screams at caterer that door cannot be opened when slide is engaged. Waiting for maint. #fml
@AmericanAir its a real shame that you guys jacked exec plat to 120 next year. Is flying every week (104 segments) not loyal enough?
@PanAmBag @SterlingTravelr hell. my @JetBlue flights from a week ago still haven't posted
Hi @AmericanAir if someone pays to watch a film on your flight. it's a major bummer when 85% of it is a pixelated. audio-skipping mess
I guess if you want to get home. you don't want to fly @AmericanAir. My wife is stuck in ORD because the pilot was 'over time'.
UGH. looks like @JetBlue is no longer my airway of choice thanks to added baggage fees and less leg room. Just another one in the mix now.
@AmericanAir is a joke! You fail to inspect something on my husband's flight. delay him for hrs. then offer a 5000 mile credit! #theworst
@united 10.00AM to Newark cancelled. Whose idea to wait until 5.30pm before postponing the 6pm Newark for 2 hours to transfer passengers?
I'm in Barcelona and I'm at a mall because @AmericanAir lost my bags. (at @Maremagnum_ in Barcelona) https://t.co/evIDKRtF9c

â€œ@USAirways: @jimzito please see a baggage agent for an update.â€ in Philly from SAT. Why are your baggage so slow? Learn from @AlaskaAir
Ugh... trying to book my New York trip with @JetBlue and I keep getting kicked out! All I want to do is book my flight :(
I'm stuck on the plane at ROC. but I give @JetBlue credit for keeping us informed.  Fingers crossed I make my connection!
Worse experience ever is @AmericanAir finding your suitcase after they didn't put it on your flight.
@united frustrating http://t.co/On9pa0QTCU
@AmericanAir Am trying to cancel a rebooked flight - new time won't get us there in time for funeral. On hold 1.5 hrs.

@Sethrogen @AmericanAir Then what? You flew in the air looking a fucking bird amazingly?
20 minutes PLUS on hold with @USAirways just to check on a vanished seat assignment. My status with @AmericanAir doesn't count on the phone
@jetblue you guys kill it EVERY time especially on the holidays! Crew on flight 118 to Boston is busting a MOVE to get us out of JFK #loveit
@americanair it was my first time flying w/ you and I will NEVER do it again!!!
So...@JetBlue to @GoingPlacesCLE ....when will @TOLAirport get any love?  Frustrating for sure....
.@caryreams Hear that @americanair? Truth. in Animal Farm reality. they all suck equally. but AA sucks more equally than others.
Never had trouble w/ @JetBlue before now. Been sitting on the tarmac waiting 4 another crew for an hr. We were already a half hr late....
@AmericanAir can you help @camerondallas or not? you're the most inconvenient airline ever. i have seen so many issues with your company.
@HDBtweets @FakeUnitedJeff @Gawker only @united can drive a man of patience to such extremes. Sadly they miss. they miss greatly.
Hey @SouthwestAir what the heck is up w/your customer service line? It keeps hanging up on me. Need to change a flight. can't do it online.

All these random delays. @americanair needs to get it's flight situation on point. Watch us miss our connecting flight in Dallas.
@DeltaAssist would you refund my ticket if the inbound flight was delayed enough to guarantee a missed connection to my final destination?
.@VirginAmerica cancels flight w/o notice. Comp 4 major inconvenience? $25! RIDICULOUS @AlaskaAir gave me $400 4similar sitch. #BooVirgin
The one thing I can count on from @SouthwestAir is that they are always delayed.
@deltaassist delayed in GRR. Ridge connection on MSP. Hope we can make it!
Way to cancel my morning flight and not tell me. @AmericanAir - stay classy.
@VirginAmerica and then I have to pay for shitty slow wifi a second time because the plane had to land due to your poor planning. Seriously?
@AmericanAir there are a bunch of people waiting at the American Counter at HSV for no luggage and NO one from American is here to help.
@SouthwestAir Please help us get a refund on our LAS tix. I cannot afford to replace more destroyed luggage. #SWApic http://t.co/UcD9y5r55W

@DeltaAssist I've lost my wallet somewhere between SF &amp; LA on DL6433. I'm hoping that you can help me find it.
@icecoldpenguin @AmericanAir don't forget the rudeness of the staff when I dropped you off.

@AmericanAir Another cancelled @USAirways flight.....Arghhh! You really know how to ruin holidays. U gonna call me to rebook?
@AmericanAir I hve family trying 2 get hme on flight AA055 MCR to ORD. delay since 9am 17/05. What's happening? flight was cancelled agn!
When McDonalds employees provide better service then then your baggage service that should be the sign of a problem. @Alitalia @DeltaAssist
Weather in Detroit &amp; Pittsburgh looks clear. So why was my @Delta flight delayed?! So much for seeing J before his trip ðŸ˜  @DeltaAssist

@SouthwestAir so Im finally on this plane after 3 delays. The pilot just said there is an issue with the sink. Now waiting on maintenance.
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir What the hell is airport things!

@bryanteslava @AmericanAir they make everyone miss their flight lmao
@AmericanAir Why drop the late BNA to DFW flight?  Makes for tough business travel when mtg ends at 5.
@SouthwestAir help! My flight has been cancelled from MSY to DAL!
I'm so sorry you had that atrocious experience @kristen. What on earth is going on with your staff @united? Disgraceful.
Oh. @AmericanAir it does not surprise me in the slightest that you lost my sisters bag on Thursday afternoon. however it does surprise me..
On hold w @JetBlue for 50 min to be told that my grandmothers death and funeral is not is not a viable reason for refunding parents flight
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
Bummed in a BIG way with @AmericanAir. Lots of run around and a missed flight. May just have to stick with @Delta from now on $ be damned
That's creepy as hell @riamichelle @JetBlue
@DeltaAssist   Landed at 5:51 am on flight 1979.  Luggage was loaded to flight.  Still don't have them yet.  Shitty way to start the day.

I'm a 1K million miler. but @united doesn't hold a seat reservation I made months ago. or provide a decent substitute. #fail
@AmericanAir delay caused missed int'l connection. ORD's AA staff won't even attempt to rebook. Call system has hung up on me 4x. #nowwhat?
@DeltaAssist may have the worse company policies when it comes to switching or canceling flights. I feel like I have been hustled every time
@ToddTVG @SimonTVG @AmericanAir  Once again proving they're the WORST.  You should have demanded flight on another airline
@DeltaAssist @Delta so what are you guys gonna do if I miss my 1:30 flight to Miami for my honeymoon?  Currently sitting on the runway #6291
@AmericanAir 4694 out of Myrtle Beach #delayed. Supposed to be on 721 in about an hour. I see my 1st class dreams fading by the minute.
@AlaskaAir really upset with you guys right now
@JetBlue. I'm disappointed in you guys. I've loved you guys because you don't nickel and dime us to death. #goodbyebrandloyalty
@united @theregoesbabs passing the buck is crap. Man up and own the mistake. Typical corporate answer. screw and confuse the customer.
Props to @SouthwestAir for the BWI tv action. Wouldn't  need this though if my bags didn't take longer than my flight http://t.co/GvtA1f8OOP
Seriously @united wifi. at 4$ an hour blocks access to @twitter now. Never has an airline worked so hard to lose customers
@DeltaAssist @KLM Can you please sort my bag issue? It's almost 24 hours since l arrived in Vancouver minus my bag. Reference is ORDDL37650
@united glad I lost weight and down to 12% body fat. Don't think I could take much more space. #plasticseatbackshurt http://t.co/aimsuoNotC

@anthonyhamlin @JetBlue Jet Blue hates the elderly
@AmericanAir how about returning my 65K miles? I swore thereafter to never fly AA again. Sad to hear you're getting my Dividend Miles.
@VirginAmerica doesn't have enough fuel for ewr to sfo. Now I have a 3 hour delay and layover in Chicago #wtf  @MilMileSecrets help!
@SouthwestAir all take a few minutes to pull up. Twitter works but slow so I'm on here. I gave up online.
HOW THE HELL DO I GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE. @AmericanAir??
@fredharrell @united You stuck?
@DeltaAssist can't wait to fill out my survey from this horrid trip. #whathappenedtocustomerservice #prettysureihavefrostbite
@united oh man. crummy start to our honeymoon united. made us pay an extra 100 dollars for being 10lbs over on luggage and terrible service
AA flight to Chicago delayed due to plane breakdown. Searching for replacement plane. Maybe they should give eBay a try? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I took 6 flights with you this past week &amp; not a single 1 occurred w/o incident. 2 inexplicably cancelled. 1 for radar failure.
@DeltaAssist but then I will be charged a fee for getting help to book the ticket.  #frustrated
. @united I kno I'm speaking on behalf of all New Mexicans in DC: very disappointed u stopped ur nonstop flight from IAD to ABQ #bringitback
@united please take care of UA2105 people. As if a 13 hour flight isn't daunting enough--they've now been delayed a full 48 hours.
@AmericanAir My GF is stuck on Bermuda due to your inept Cus Service that appear to have no clue #Bermuda #GonzaloBDA
@DeltaAssist @Delta Flight for 5 hours from now cancelled. Phone line says to use app or web. but those say to call. Phone 1.5+ wait time!
@united yes at the airport and followed up on the phone. very disappointed considering i was was also first class.
@fakemikemulloy @AmericanAir they're responding in english to foreign languages to show that they "tried" but don't give a fuck
@SouthwestAir 'customer service' rep just gave us major attitude because they cancelled our flight. We 'were' advocates until today. #badcs
@united What @gadgetgirl_ca . her family and everyone on that flight are experiencing is unacceptable!
@drewmichael @kylekinane @united the status of the flight was delayed up until last minute when it wasn't delayed and the flight left ontime
@SouthwestAir how does a computer inside a suitcase full of clothes get dented? How do screws on a remote control get bent? A Lil too rough?
@JetBlue lots of people waiting at your counter at #pdx trying to drop off bags. When do you staff this counter? http://t.co/7firY4dzw4
@citycynic @JetBlue @Jen_eration_x Well that just totally ruined my day.
@DeltaAssist GU6JMU cancelled and moved to tmrw. Hoping for DL1058/DL5025 today...can you do that? Res shows over but I can buy on DL .com
Hey @united--know what makes "customer service" delays better? A round of drinks on the house for every passenger who didn't delay the plane
@DeltaAssist at tpa for tpa-atl-btv. Flight now delayed 2 hours. will miss cnn to btv. Help? Traveling with 3 kids
Dear @JetBlue. you guys have been great. But planes from mco to nyc keep getting delayed. I've got a match Saturday and t-shirts to sell.
@mashable That is really scary. Not good for @JetBlue. #CmonMan
@AmericanAir Not enough characters in a DM to list all the disappointments with my AA experience. Guess I'll have to go to website. Sigh.
shout out to @united for never getting back to me about my complaint. i didn't have my luggage for a week. annnd my stuff was damaged
What's going on. @Jetblue?! Boss's flight JFK-TPA 1025 was cancelled for no reason. but luggage was x'ed to LAX?! Now he's missing a conf!
Adventures in @JetBlue today. Flight cancelled yesterday; now delayed 2.5 hours a day later. No crew. Missing work; can't educate the youth

@AmericanAir Flew your airline today &amp; my baggage was returned extremely damaged. Agents were rude &amp; unhelpful. How can I file a complaint?

@JetBlue #jetblue flight389 creeping delay 20 Min. 40 min to 60 min

@JetBlue ...but were still split up. flying on @VirginAmerica. which is not what we wanted. Telling me to "leave a note" fixes nothing 4 fam
@AmericanAir Flight to ORD delayed without reason. connection missed. and you put us up in a hotel that charges for wifi?! Bad start to wknd
Another @united #FAIL just sitting at IAD &amp; no one to load the bags - really?
@SouthwestAir on a complete full flight 1614 Dal-Den. you allowed a passenger that needs two seats to wedge in the middle. Unacceptable.
I had good experiences with @JetBlue during this trip but 20 mins late. 20 min on Tarmac and 20 and counting at baggage. on Xmas. not cool.
@SouthwestAir @raysweihere Possibilty of it getting delayed. #lolarmyofficial possibility(:

@AmericanAir  $35 for the second bag for gold members. I've been 10 years loyal to you.  This stinks @USAirways

@AmericanAir so sick of this confusing set up of terminals. lack of communication and rude apathetic employees
Quite dreadful @JetBlue terrible. awful customer service reps at JFK. 2 hour queue for 1 rep ? Worst airline I've ever used #JustSaying
@AmericanAir apparently you don't want my business anymore! I have emailed you twice now and STILL haven't heard back! Ridiculous!!

@amieernst @united Nope. Sad trombone/
@united has no idea how to treat their customers 8hr flight with friend and sat separate the entire flight.  #fail #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir Disappointed the planes do not have charging outlets! Do any? Pd for Wifi and will run out of battery before landing :(
@DDonatelo30 @CNET @united I'm not an aircraft expert but any external intervention should be a security issue. regardless of the system
This is quite simply unacceptable. It's 2015! @united http://t.co/mNbJfs8CTP
So.my @AmericanAir flight is delayed but.do we wait by the gate where there's AC. food. etc.?Nope. inside the plane for  30min so far. no AC
Flyer beware! @united is going to punish you for missing flights! http://t.co/WDxZz0Ky5C via @upgrd @rohanaanand
@united is it possible to get a DM regarding some technical issues I am having on your career site?
@DrJohnRosen @Whitney9News @united the missing pilots must have corrupted the baggage handlers #NoShow
@JetBlue I left a 3DS on a flight to Boston ~30mins ago. Getting poor support on the phone. Anyway you can help? Flight lands at 9PM EST.
@AmericanAir no priority access at @fly2ohare anymore? Why do I bother with loyalty if the greatest benefit has been pulled?
@DeltaAssist where do I make a claim for damaged checked item? My child's car seat was damaged on DL1881
Stuck on tarmac.  @AmericanAir boarded delayed flight 2467 then pilot comes on at 1:30 to say we can't depart until after 3:00?! @KTVN

@AmericanAir Hi. I can't get a response to my recent customer relations email or reach a CR phone rep for a direct answer. very frustrated.
Called @SouthwestAir the night before last and the CS agent asked why I couldn't have a "normal" name like Sally. Still mad. #offended ðŸ˜¡
Q: An @AmericanAir flight is scheduled to leave an hour before a @virginamerica flight with same route. Who arrives first? A: Virgin America
This 3-hour delay would be more acceptable if @JetBlue would cover drinks for the wait. You know. at least buy me a drink before you fuck me
@united. How can you lost a priority bag on a nonstop flight? This guy's changing cities daily bc of book signing! https://t.co/wQTf3RqNBi
@AmericanAir what's the typical wait time? Already sat on Tarmac for 3 hrs. Airport line is 2hrs long. Other options? http://t.co/AqP5yJhJTp
Shout out to @AmericanAir and the @the_USO for making a trip full of horrible @united customer service a little easier.
Very disappointed in @AmericanAir Rome experience. Paid WAY too much for Business Class to sit on 2 hot buses. Such bad experience! #getgate
Choose @united if you want your flight to constantly get delayed. and sit in the airport all day.
What happened @SouthwestAir for #flight 512? I have been at the airport since 9 am. #travel #Orlando #LA #patientlywaiting #delay #director
Hey @SouthwestAir why charge people for "a" seating then others on ahead? IE not handicapped #frustrated #nothappeningagain #planeshalffull

@united The flight last night (UA 1195) &amp; your crew were first rate. But the 1.5 hour delay while you brought us our bags was intolerable.
"We have a great. beloved airline. Let's destroy it" -@JetBlue (I'm paraphrasing) http://t.co/fszHu9EsSm
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago. without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@united provided the worst possible flight experience today. 7 hours waiting. then canceling the flight.

@AmericanAir flight #1213 #sfo to #dfw was 2.5 hours late leaving and we've been waiting 20 min for the door to open!!!! Surprised we came?
@AmericanAir  I've now spent about 5 hours on the tarmac between two days and two flights. Ridiculous. Some weather but some ineptitude too.
1K uses RPU to put wife into F going home for thanksgiving. the upgrade clears a month ago. and she gets downgraded!! Bad form @United.
@SouthwestAir  Threatening a poor girl with a dying puppy with COPS?  You are meanest horrible company out there.  #racist @ThatKevinSmith
@scalzi @jzb There’s people who fly @united who don’t want to be screwed?
Cleaning out some old stuff... about to throw out the suitcase that @AmericanAir destroyed and never replaced. #TBT :P lmao.
@united   Worst experience with United. Won't be using them again. Fly another airline! Applying for an American miles credit card!
@SouthwestAir fuck your company. You're a bunch of thieves and liars
@united what's up with @fly2ohare ops? Waiting 1.5 hrs for gate. UA1002
Nothing worse than sitting at your gate &amp; @AmericanAir not letting you on your flight when the door is open. Unbelievably disappointed.
Three people working @united counter at #Atlanta and 1 working premier counter and customers waiting.  What's the point.
@DeltaAssist yes i did a while back! Never heard from delta
@VirginAmerica Want to go from FLL to SAN in july but you have no flights listed after April 27th. what's the deal?
@AmericanAir Horrible flight attendant service on my flight back to NYC! She physically touched me and I almost fell! #UnAcceptable
Every time I fly @united I get delayed. miss flights. and dont arrive to my destination until 24hrs later than scheduled #cmonnow #helpmeout
What the fuck. @AmericanAir canceled one of my flights without telling me. They gave me a number to fix it and the number doesn't work
@SouthwestAir Spouse managed to escape the fiasco in Jackson MS re: #2141 and get a #USAirways flight back to DC. Bag still lost in transit.
@united you sent a broken link
@United I need a corporate level contact to discuss issues that have occurred over the last 24 hours and not Customer Care.
@rzen MSP Terminal 2 is the same. Just found out @SouthwestAir is killing their MSP/GRR flights though :(
When you miss a flight due to your own negligence. atleast you know where to place the blame. @united #airlineofchoice
@JetBlue partnered with @SilverAirways horrible idea! Cancelled &amp; delayed flights. lost luggage. no customer service! #dontflysilver
@AmericanAir then my flight this morning arrived late so I missed my flight to my final destination so annoying now I'm sitting here waiting
@SouthwestAir Worst flight experience flying to Houston from NYC and pathetic customer service for getting help to reschedule.
This in flight wifi SUCKS. I can't believe I paid $33.95 for it. @AmericanAir your service BLOWS. Changing my return flight on Monday ugh.
â€œ@ColleenB123: I have the worst luck with airlines. @AmericanAir lost my luggage. Someone Help! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­â€ @imALLLYouneed
Made it to the seat selection page four times for @JetBlue's #breaktheice sale and never successfully made it through - super dissapointed
I will never fly @united  again
I'm really disappointed by @JetBlue's plans to devolve what has made them great all along. you guys are better than that!
@AmericanAir I had to retrieve the ticket number. locator lxygqe.. Can I just use dividend number -SO much easier. Flight was late too
Visited @united's website to accept my evoucher for our 3 hour delay last weekend and got an error message. at least it's not a fuel leak...
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@united Airlines lost my daughters car seat. not once but TWICE!!! Once on the way to MCO &amp; once on the way back. That is talent!
@AlaskaAir is it usually your policy to tell ppl to wait until 12:30am for baggage delivery and then not have your driver show up? #nothappy
@SouthwestAir you can un delay the fucking flight from LGA to MDW that's the only thing that will help
After all these years. bye bye @JetBlue . No longer a loyal flier with your BS fees. Looking forward to finding a new airline.
Anyone else had stuff #stolen from their suitcase at #EWR when flying with #UnitedAirlines?? ;( ;( ;( @united @NY_NJairports
@AmericanAir hey you guys have lost my luggage twice in the same week. This unacceptable and I don't have access to my medication now

Every time I fly @AmericanAir something happens. First flight delayed. crew put my bag on wrong belt. missed my next flight by few mins.
It's a shame how @AmericanAir treats you with no respect after flying with them for so many years! Nobody gives you an answer!
Flight got delayed as the aircraft has to be replaced. At least they figured it out BEFORE the take-off @United
Delay 1 + delay 2 &gt;round trip flight time. 50% on bags both ways. #notupsetjustdisappointed @united
Fuck you. @United Airlines. @theregoesbabs https://t.co/SAsqoPWEmm
@united #ua590 lax-ogg two hours late so far. sitting at gate waiting to board. Maybe a meal voucher?? #UnitedAirlines
I've never had such an awful experience checking in for a flight. @AmericanAir I now have a grudge against one of your employees ðŸ˜¡
@DunkinDonuts @JetBlue #DunkinGOSweeps California - I've never seen the west coast
@JetBlue has delayed flight 127 twice now out of Newark- why ?! #getmeoutofhere #thisisrediculous
@americanair what is your costumer service email address?    I have a problem.
@united @anthonythomas93  Ya you guys suck
@AmericanAir Hour on the phone trying to get $ back for a ticket never used. If employees tell me I'll get my $ back maybe follow through?
@dfwairport car flow at Terminal E is a disaster. I've never seen such a mess. No wonder @VirginAmerica left. They couldn't get in the term
@united I have to disagree.  No video on an international flight yet wifi is available at a cost of $2 per hour in first class.  Epic fail
Hey @Delta @DeltaAssist ive been on hold for 32 mins and counting with skymiles! Is there going to every be anyone answering my call? #Delta
Another reason to hate @united “@fark: What's the deal. @united? Please unblock us. http://t.co/CZ2wgrFQ5O”
@united you told a passenger that they would be able to make a connecting flight. despite a 2 hour delay.  Now they are stranded.  #yousuck
Hi. Been waiting for our bags for an hour. Fuck you @jetblue #jetblue #sucks #boston #wherethefuckarubags
@MrDetermined713 @ChesterPitts @united @iah United has the worse costumer service at IAH
42 minutes now. RT @TEvans927: @USAirways @AmericanAir I’ve been on hold trying to buy a ticket for 30 minutes. Anyone home?
@united So let's get this straight United has switched my seat from "Economy plus window" to a MIDDLE for the 3rd flight in a row - GARBAGE
@AmericanAir your wifi sucks!!!!!
Too bad @DavidJBarger does't give a shit about his customersâ€”officially can't prioritize/recommend @JetBlue over other airlines anymore.
@jmspool Hey. did you fix @united? This flight isn't bad at all. i've got a power outlet and coffee.
Bad work @JetBlue limiting security question answers to alpha. Names have hyphens and accents as do many of the other things you ask
@AmericanAir what you don't understand is that your baggage people never scanned the bags. they never left #Dallas. #fail
@DeltaAssist @Delta this flight has tried to take off THREE times with the same issue. Lots of pissed off people. #DL1196
@AmericanAir After 1 hour. and 15 minutes I hung up. I have other things to do than to wait that long for some help. but it's alright.
Delayed flight into Zurich by 5 hours makes @usskiteam guys miss charter flight to osd : Race tomorrow. @DeltaAssist @Delta please help.
Officially @united is the worst airline in the whole world #Facts #fail #nightmare #NTA2015
@JetBlue Landed in CHS 40 min ago..still waiting for my luggage...&amp; that was before someone's bag got jammed.Grrrrrrr http://t.co/MFZhRL3Fmp
by far @AmericanAir was my worst flying experience. but hello Miami.
@stanyee @AmericanAir @angelafritz Ugh Stan. who wants to watch &amp; be scared to fly?
@jdavidadler @aayoub @VersoBooks @Delta @DeltaAssist Virgin Mary wore veil Nuns wear veil What's your problem with Muslim women wearing veil
@JetBlue glad your shareholders are happy. Your customers think it sucks.  Lots of other choices out there... http://t.co/6ef1IdK1Yw
@AmericanAir serious issues with miscommunications on trip to DC from Tulsa. there will be a customer service contact! #hadtoleaveamanbehind
@AmericanAir You have to do better! You cancelled flights and no email/call/text and your customer service is the worst! #atl #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir How long to wait for a cstmr scv mgr?  DFW.  C4.  Should have been home yesterday...  Now I'm paying for a hotel?  Really????
@iamwill @united Maybe u shouldnt of been such a disrespectful twat 2 the staff working there &amp; all the other passengers u would b delaying
I can't have my laptop on my lap but he can have his fucking whining. smelly dog on his. #loser makes no sense. @united @FAANews
Another flight on @SouthwestAir means another ridiculous delay. Hopefully i make it home before I have to be at work in the am
@AmericanAir lost my brand new luggage on my honeymoon. It has been three days and it's still missing. DM ASAP #helpabrideout
#SaveOurKnees @JetBlue I'd hate to have to switch airlines =/
@SouthwestAir I'm at a loss. Flights cancelled due to fog...why not just delay?? MDW -&gt; MSY vacation delayed by a day now. #bummedoutbigtime
@AmericanAir sucks big time. How did the agent take all my information. place me on hold to check something then disconnect the call. 😈
@DeltaAssist trying to use your new delta portal on our flight from sfo to ny and it's not working
@AmericanAir The hotel shuttle has a problem but the crew doesnâ€™t take a cab instead of delaying the flight further?
@AmericanAir No management to field my issue? You wrongly cost me $ by admitted screwup. Pulled up proof in AA's own iPhone app.
Hello from California! ... with missing luggage. #upset @alaskaair
Flying @VirginAmerica is great except for the dreadful safety tips "music video." A sharp stick in my ear is preferable. "Robot rap." guys.
I won't be flying @AmericanAir ever again.  Hearing about 10+ hours on hold AND rude CSR's?   @PhilGizzi #AmericanAirlines #MakeItRight
@DeltaAssist I need to change my FF# on an existing reservation and it won't let me do this online. I have been on hold for 40 mins. now
@SouthwestAir Hoping flight to Denver today is better than my OCT 12 -&gt; CUN.  Trish was worst flight attendant I've encountered on SWA
@DeltaAssist is there a particular reason that it's freezing in terminal 2 at jfk this morning ? Is the heat not working ? #icecold
: @united changed our flight direct from EWE to AUS w/o notice have to transfer terminals in IAH in 30 min. Home 4hrs late #nothappy
@SouthwestAir waited 15 mins to speak to a representative over the phone only to have the call w/ rep last less than 1 min. What a shame.
@sree @united Ugh. Seriously. @DeltaAssist has been far and wide the best.
31 hours to fly from YVR to OKC. @AmericanAir you are truly a terrible airline. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir flight from MAD to JFK arrived late. baggage delayed an hour. Missed conn to PIT. Treated as if it was our fault. Poor service.
I will NEVER fly @AmericanAir ever again. I was exposed to some very inappropriate things while on a flight to New York. So disappointed.
@jetblue  Come on Jet Blue.  Time to waive change fees for Xmas eve.  A lot of  holidays are going to be ruined if you don't.  Please?!
The only benefit of being delayed 24 hours by @AmericanAir is I get to fly @VirginAtlantic on the way back now. Instantly better service!!
@OneRepublic @united fuck me
Dear @JetBlue  Based on how you've treated @MatthewLush I will never ever fly your airline. So unprofessional!!!
@VirginAmerica im in LA. have a flight out to NYC at 1150 that you say may be delayed i dont have enough cell batt to wait 40min on hold.
@DeltaPoints @DeltaAssist @Delta upgraded me to PC no problem!  i just chose to stop using @Hertz because they were a rip off :)
@AmericanAir Is there is a delay for EQM hitting my account for an @AlaskaAir flight that is an AA codeshare?
.@united @AmericanAir @USAirways &amp; others. Your bag charge scam ruins air travel. Too many roller bags on flights. Ban roller bags!
I don't think @AmericanAir ever intended that my flight leave Logan on time. Next time. I'm taking Delta.
@united @LGA you never responded to this.  I demand some compensation for the unplanned visit to Bosnia.
Gave @AmericanAir another chance &amp; they screw it up. Won't assign my seat until at gate - then give me back of plane. middle seat.
@united passengers on UA657 out of DC need help; 3-hr delay. and multiple plane delay......still no resolution
@SouthwestAir can you help me via DM please? 4 hours on hold over the last 2 days is too much
@SouthwestAir what's going on with your prices from smf to sna? @jetblue is killing you with their prices to long beach!
@united Smart idea to board without a pilot. Now waiting 45 minutes. At least A/C finally came on.
@AlaskaAir no pets on 1st class was I get my own plane. Wow. Never again will I fly with you.
@AmericanAir Cancelled our flight. put us on US Air #3477 and left our luggage in JFK without letting customers know! Y'all are awful.
@Dancemomchristi @united that is terrible!! Is poor Clara with you?
@DeltaAssist The pilot for flight 2356 never showed up! Come on Delta you can do better!
Seething. Not only did @americanair delay my flight by 7 hours -- now they've lost my luggage. too. You have to be kidding me. Horrible.
@AmericanAir Worst airline to fly with International. the air line must revisit their international flying regulations.
@united your website isn't working AND your tech support people keep hanging up on me! I'm trying to book a flight and am very unhappy
Not confident flying on @united again. 2+ hr "maintenance" delay from ORD to LHR.Makes me wonder if I should place my faith in @AmericanAir
@ericmateer @JetBlue My flight has been sitting on the tarmac for over an hour! Is it because of this idiot!? Never flying JetBlue again!!!
My flight was delayed 4 times in an hour and now its leaving after midnight and a 50 minute wait to talk to a  service rep @SouthwestAir
@blackenterprise that's because @AmericanAir customer service is horrible and their losing business. I was once a loyal customer.
ATL to LGA flight 3674 to @AmericanAir just deboarded due to mechanical issues. :( hoping for the best.  Need to get home tonight
@AmericanAir I am waiting for a response to my January 2. 2015 email to your customer relations people.
6am flight still waiting to take off out of bing.  Hey @united we need to make our 7:56 out of Newark!! #holdthatplane
@OhStephanieSM stuck at LAX @Delta flight delayed &amp; gave us no options 4 tonight I am #donewithdelta next year #smmw will fly @AmericanAir
Very disorganized with a cancelled flight from MDW to LGA. @SouthwestAir. long lines. lost luggage.  Unimpressed!
Man. and I thought @united flight attendants were horrible before they were all infected with ebola. @thehill
@ColleenB123 @SouthwestAir are you kidding me? That's ridiculous. I'm sorry.
@DeltaAssist There is ZERO excuse in the year 2015 that I should have to wait on hold for over 90 mins. to speak to someone!
“@united: We will void the bookings for tickets as a result of a third-party currency conversion error.” Boo hiss suck it up. United!
7 delays and 1 canceled flights? Come on. @SouthwestAir #holdthatplane
@AmericanAir delayed departure from London. missed connection in Miami. No help from your staff. no accommodation provided. Terrible service
@JetBlue flight was supposed to depart at 12pm. and I'm still here waiting inside the stupid airplane and its 12.40pm already? I'm hungry...
Seriously @united I understand aircraft changes but moving a 1K from first to a middle seat is unacceptable.
@united really no tv on a 5 hour flight to Vegas!
@united airlines held my plane for 30 mins for one person making 90% of everyone miss there connecting flight. Never fly @united airlines.
@AmericanAir has a piano version of "rude" playing on the jet. Hopefully they're not projecting any interactions to be had with the crew.
Hi @AmericanAir you guys suck assholes
Everyone knows @united airlines has always been shit. #unitedfortahera
Come on @AmericanAir... this is the THIRD time I have called today and waited over 20 minutes to reschedule my flight. I wanna go home!!!
@united I just got a vm that my 5pm flight LGA to BOS is cancelled. but can't get someone on the phone to get on another flight. Help please
81 bags left in Chicago by @united. not getting here until tonight. Worst recent travel experience. So much for #friendlyskies
.@alaskaair fail: 3 weeks ago got stuck in SEA overnight. Wrote long letter. never heard back. Last night: stuck in SEA again on same flight
@JetBlue on hold for over 30 minutes now.trying 2 change flight but originally purchased xtra space seat.can I change flight &amp; do same HELP
@so_lucas @MatthewLush @JetBlue I agree u Luke.. what the actual fuck?
@peteleetweets @AmericanAir How many of them have been all screwed up?!
@AmericanAir bad experience when the plane has maintenance issues. board us anyways &amp; make us sit on the plane for an hour.
Yo @united I'm on one of your new planes. why aren't there any fucking TVs? Let me remind you. it's 2015. Preparing for an uneventful 4hrs.
@deltaassist please hold DL101. You guys are having my flight from sfo-atl sit on Tarmac. and it's a long way to gate E29!
Don't fly American Airlines or Us Airways! When something goes wrong they'll tell you "its not their problem" @AmericanAir @USAirways
Wish @AmericanAir would answer their phones! Been on hold for over an hour.
@united I have a typo in my name. mathijsa instead of Mathijs. Problem? #ua383
@Delta @SouthwestAir do you screw customers when a flight is cancelled like @AmericanAir does? #screwthecustomer
Just tried to notify @JetBlue that I found lower fares for my exact flight. and was told I'd be charged $75.00 to get a credit?! Ridiculous.
@united Sitting on plane for 2 hours because of broken chair in cockpit?! Screaming toddlers. no water offered. keepin it classy. UA 1747.
As seen on a @united itinerary. Seriously. what the hell is an "International Surcharge"? That one's new to me http://t.co/HfRgkg3had
@DeltaAssist Doubt it over 144 characters on Twitter. Plus. it's taken you 2 days to respond already. You guys are just a horrible company.
@angegarrod @ClassicFM Unfortunately. @united airlines has ruined Rhapsody in Blue for me after so many minutes on hold and in UA terminals.
@DeltaAssist It looks like I'm going to miss my flight DL6440 because LA traffic is at a standstill from the marathon. Can you help? :)
@AlaskaAir flt 2328 PDX to Sea is 20 min late. I should make my connection to Philadelphia. #travel
@SouthwestAir I'm 30 mins out WAIT FOR ME😭😭😭
@united plus if I don't get to Laramie by 530. I lose my rental car....I was supposed to land at 1:53. #flight5450 #annoying
Stardust still looking for his cosmic key? maybe @united lost that too!!
@AmericanAir  What terrible customer service. Sure there can be weather problems but why is no one at the gate when people get off to help?
@united worst boarding process ever. Enforce the small bags go under the seat rule!
@AmericanAir cancelled my wife's 1st class flight and making her fly coach because the 1st class ticket on the new flight costs more money.
when your airline is flaw as fuck @USAirways @AmericanAir http://t.co/z5rQQhQfah
@camerondallas @AmericanAir HOW DID U MISS IT CAM
@united First image where #UnitedAirlines made us late a whole day by turning around our plane after flying 2
Landed in JAX! But there is no gate for us. Jetblue fail. So much for making it to the beach before dinner.. first vaca since xmas @JetBlue
@SouthwestAir Once again. your in-flight wifi is a waste &amp; frustration. Horrible for this biz traveler. #epicfail #travelerswoes #southwest
@AmericanAir is the WORST! If they say "give me a second change" DON'T ! I regret !!
Sat on the Tarmac in Phoenix waiting for an open gate while my connecting @USAirways flight to SLC departed. Now what? @AmericanAir
@CestMoiSaraLou I've had only bad experiences with @united when traveling abroad. I hope you end up with better help than I did!
@JetBlue - do not fly Jet Blue international out of JFK! Lost 2 days of paid vacation because of them. happened to others also. never again.
@AmericanAir i had this problem on the same flight on 10/22/13.  Shame on me for booking twice...
My hubs missed his flight due to @AmericanAir staff error. Had to purchase a new ticket out of pocket. They will not help. SO FRUSTRATED.
@JetBlue I loved u but today's announcement means I'll no longer go out of my way to fly u. Good for ur shareholders. bad for pax.
@united Flight 1154 delayed. Sitting here for an hour since boarding. Bag issues. This is why united scares me.
This trip to Dallas comprised of 2 flights w/ 2 hour delays. and a cancelled flight. @SouthwestAir has handled my woes with class &amp; respect.
@united  #OVEHJ5 I would have stayed put for 2 more days and NOT wasted my mileage to get back home!  All this loyalty for punishment?
How has @jetBlue been lately ?  Haven't flown with them in a while ?  I was MISERABLE on my so called @Delta "Upgrade" last flight.
Yay for delayed flights ✈️ .....not @SouthwestAir
@alaskaair your flight 745 was 6 minutes late. Just an fyi. Thanks. frequent flyer Veruca.
@delta Nevermind. still on hold &amp; don't have time for this. Trying later. I didn't have this problem with @Americanair #airlinesgettingworse
@united You are singlehandedly the worst airline ever. No customer service. cancelled flights and overbooking. #neveragain #dontflyunited
Hello @United. this wait for baggage from UA #1667 Denver-Newark is grotesquely unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir wants me to like them on facebook while the flight is late. Pilots haven't shown up for work yet. Flight 1240 Chicago to Hou.
@united WHY DOES YOUR REZ CALL CENTER THAT YOU OUTSOURCED OVERSEAS SUCK SO MUCH? I HOLD FOR HRS &amp; THEN YOUR AGENTS SPEAK GIBBERISH. #hateyou
@AmericanAir you've pushed the time AA 1269 3x already...Richmond is not off the gate A8. Don't keep us here and then cancel!
On again a #fail on #goingforgreat on @AmericanAir .... 100+ bags so far and not a premium tag to be found. #loyaltybeingchallenged
.@united This is a joke. Check in w/your app. pay for bags w/app. arrive at airport &amp; wait forever. http://t.co/3j3ccoe2OP
@PaigingLauren @AmericanAir terrible. NOW I'M MAD.
@AmericanAir 1-month since AA cancelled a flight and still waiting on refund; 0 response to my email and AA provides no phone # to call
@AmericanAir. this is ridiculous. I've been in hold and can't get to anyone. This is utterly preposterous #DoBetter http://t.co/v5aEaotV0X
@camerondallas @AmericanAir meanwhile cam tweeting his person flight  issues _ hope you get a flight soon xx_
@Slackular @MrConservative_ @JetBlue Adds value. If you aren't part of the solution (police) . you're part of the problem (criminals).
My flight got cancelled due 2 maint.. but agent is loading passenger on the same plane 2 different destination. What's going on@SouthwestAir
Agreed. pathetic service! RT @SauBomb @British_Airways arrive at Miami int only to find out been put into an @AmericanAir flight #KillMeNow
"@fostersiebken: @AmericanAir the weather didn't leave me here on this cot http://t.co/Mvt6UVS3q6" lol whyyyy
Another flight delayed.... Last night and now this morning... @SouthwestAir
@united waited 25 mins to speak to agent. Transferred to supervisor. Waited 25 more mins. She hung up on me upon answering #HorribleService
@MarshaCollier @JetBlue To bad. There's got to be another way for Airlines to do business other jamming us in like cattle.
@AmericanAir proving once again that I should have flown @United - no flight attendant now means we "might" arrive East coast at 3 AM. Grrrr
@SouthwestAir these maintenance delays are getting ridiculous. Third one for my family in 3 weeks.
Hey @united what's a reasonable amount of time to wait for my bag? @dominos could have brought me a pizza by now #DEN
@TheAmberLager @DolceMelis no matter what the problems @SouthwestAir is still better than @AmericanAir  any day
Most @AmericanAir flights departing #OHare are still cancelled at this hour @TelemundoNews http://t.co/YQVPjkDAVD
@JetBlue NOT a good move. Arent the lower gas prices good enough to reach the bottom line? http://t.co/sweFUSGZfK
@AmericanAir your automated phone system will NOT accept my last name. No matter how clearly and how many times. Very frustrating.
I will NEVER fly @united as long as live #United #unitedairlines #missingsouthwest http://t.co/dHKWNvZ9BN
Ticket says operated by US Airways. Must be code for operated by American #FAIL @USAirways and @AmericanAir
You guys suck flights 2hrs late and the people that work for you are asshole  @united
@iloveradio @united Ohhh... heart broke... :(
@AmericanAir long &amp; unfortunate delay for flt AA1304 DFW 2 DAY. :-(.
@richardmarx Don't you know?  @united won't give up until you're dissatisfied.
@AmericanAir After a wait for over two hours for a call back the agent transferred me back to the ex plat deck. another two hours. #hateAA
@SouthwestAir Flight 177 out of LAS delayed again. Shocking â€” why is this flight perpetually late? Did I select the wrong airline? #noLuv :(
Using @AmericanAir was a bad decision. Probably the worst flight experience I've had.
I'm about to pay $720 for a flight that my friend paid $530 for. This shit really fucking irks me. @united
@JetBlue disapp. re:baggage fees. Exclusively fly JetBlue bc of great cs and baggage policy.Bummed you're becoming like the rest - not cool
@AmericanAir What's the email where I can make a complaint? Your unprofessional staff made me miss my flight. #stuckattheairport
@SouthwestAir Extremely disappointed. Canceled my upcoming flight. missing a day's pay. Was promised drink vouchers. waiting over a month.
@AmericanAir #cybermondaycodenot working for vacations
I bought a gift card that I wouldn't mind keeping for myself @SouthwestAir gift card! Let's get the hell outta here!
You're really screwing me @united airways. @SouthwestAir has never done me like that
@americanair @usairways 2nd cancelled flight of the day for 2 different reasons. operator can't get me on a new flight until WEDNESDAY?
I am a little upset w @DeltaAssist  the other flight they scheduled me on they upgraded me 2 1st class &amp; now on the 7pm flight they didn't
@AmericanAir it's been over 1 month since I emailed you. How much longer do I have to wait before my problem is solved? Ref#: 1-2660723499
And the award for the worst flight service and ill-tempered employees available goes to... *drum rollll* @AmericanAir
Hey @united get better hold music I'm not digging 20 minute of this slow jazz stuff
Hey @united. any chance you can pay for the hotel I will have to get in SFO because my flight was cancelled?  I'm poor.
@united basing a fee that is more than the cost of the entire flight is unacceptable. @VirginAmerica will get my business from now on
@LarsHanson @CMPunk @AmericanAir  Delta is by far the worst lost my bags several times.
@united Was on hold for 2 hours this morning and never got to talk to a rep. Fixed now. but a cancellation now has me 24hrs behind schedule.
@deltaassist just received email. @delta changed my flight from IAD to NBO. Now leave hours earlier. Doesn't really work for me.
@SouthwestAir also tried to blame it on LAX and now costing me money for extra parking and having to call off of work. SO SO IRRITATED.
@AmericanAir flight gets cancelled (understand) have to call in to change and been getting dropped for two days straight. Terrible guys!!
@AmericanAir Lost my bags for the second time in the same trip.. What's going on?
@VirginAmerica on the phone for two hours waiting for a rep.. So crazy
Depart 9:06pm DL9096.  Will waiting to takeoff.  Come on.  @DeltaAssist
@united Please fix the html in your flight itinerary email. You open a th tag but close it with a td. that's likely why it looks bad gmail.
@united how the hell can U cancel my ticket? When I do a mistake and want to cancel u charge me a fee!!! No apologies???!!It's unacceptable
@jetblue been on hold 25 mins and counting to book a getaway! :( Why is it such a long wait on a Wednesday night?
@AmericanAir still no responses
@AmericanAir return trip...I just DM'd you again. Your pilot has just announced another airline error causing an indefinite delay.
@Unclekage @united The sun is shining in Seattle. Odd. I know. but it's the first time I've heard of it delaying a flight.
@AmericanAir Never again will I rely on American Air. We have been stranded for nearly 6 hours and have missed out on a trip of a lifetime.
@AmericanAir you canceled my flight and won't let me get through to an agent. The one you switched me to doesn't work for me. Please respond
Ran from work to make my @AmericanAir flight only to be delayed on the flight with no notice ahead of time. #disappointing
Hey there @AmericanAir want to help me out here? My flight is cancelled with no others tonight...why oh why don't you even pay for my hotel?
Reminder not 2 book on @AmericanAir especially going through #Dallas. Often delayed and rushing 2 make connections. Hope I make mine 2day.
@OpTic_Crimsix @united Crim was about to get it. Fucking untied
@SouthwestAir Been on hold for over 45 minutes trying to rebook a cancelled flight. This is ridiculous.
Figures my @AmericanAir #usairways flight is cancelled and they wont pick up phone and won't let me change it online
@SouthwestAir if y'all could just once let me travel without a delay I would be so greatful. This is like 4 flights in a row...
@gaystarnews @AmericanAir Still waiting to hear from American Airlines based in Dallas TX. Their silence speak words!!!!
@JoeyDiggsJr @AmericanAir Are you still waiting?? This can't be real... :(
@VirginAmerica I emailed customer service a response 8 days ago with still no response. Why is it taking so long?
First it was @jarpad with @AmericanAir &amp; now it's @JensenAckles with @AlaskaAir  Why do airlines like annoy our boys
@DeltaAssist Can you give me a email contact for the sky miles program?  I had a question and it has been a month and no response online.
Alaska Airlines has kicked off one of their planes a cancer patient. I won't be flying Alaska Air anytime soon. @AlaskaAir #alaskaairsucks
@ClassicSydney @AmericanAir ya you guys are rude
Waiting on @JetBlue to fly into DAB. I hate flying into MCO but it's the next best thing
That time I paid $300 for a flight and @JetBlue offered to refund me $88. #worstcustomerservice
@DeltaAssist @Delta I've been in airports for the past 24 hours. and Now another delayed flight. Another we're sorry.  Always Fly @united
Watching a careless @AmericanAir employee drop bags from the undercarry. I hope this is not how you handle my bag. http://t.co/e0BtV7rsiW
Kind of afraid I'm going to have the @VirginAmerica safety song stuck in my head forever. #underyourseatthereisalifevest
Holy shit. get me off this plane! It's fucking freezing with my hoodie on! By far. coldest flight I've ever been on @SouthwestAir.
I hate to fly and now my 12 year old daughter is sitting elsewhere in the plane because @priceline had our seats listed @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir so disappointed in this airline and the rude service and gate agent Monica b35 @loganairports
@united connection flight in houston several hours no customer service. no compassion
So #Unhappy with @united just spent 3hrs in ATL traffic to find @TheShelbyDoll flight cancelled! No call no text no flight until tomorrow 😡😡
@united Please help get us to Nationals in Orlando today! Our flight got cancelled. We worked all year 4 this! #getsyokicklinetonationals
"@mstupenengo:Nice to wake up at 4 am to discover on the way to the airport that @AmericanAir cancelled my flights."You can go to bed again!
@DeltaAssist I originally booked a virgin flight but got placed on a delta flight. The seating was cramped and the food was atrocious.
@united Unacceptable treatment of the young autistic girl &amp; family. I will not fly #UnitedAirlines again as long as I have a choice.
@DeltaAssist locked out and after staying on hold for 20 minutes gave up and booked a flight on @united
@united Just called MileagePlus per your recommendation. nothing different from what I could read online. Disappoint after waiting 30 min.
@AmericanAir Just got notified our flight to ORD has been cancelled. It's AA3520. I'm on hold but perhaps Twitter can be faster?
is there anything worse than sitting on a delayed @united plane. watching the odds making your connection shrink by the minute?
I try to fly @AmericanAir as little as possible despite being an EXP. the new meals are disgusting and inedible. domestic and international
@SouthwestAir pls start listing all stops on flights. Stuck at Midway &amp; would have changed flight if had known in advance
@AmericanAir you didn't ticket my award flight. found about it just at the airport. waited 2 nerve wrecking hours to sort it out.. 1/2
Landed. sitting on the tarmac for 30min and counting bc @united doesn't have their shit together.
@united :enjoying the new E175 from ORD- ATL; but another comedy of delays. Supposed to depart at 0930 now ETD will easily be past 11. Sigh
Flying home today from my UK/Ireland tour &amp; @united never fails to disappoint. Flight delayed 30 minutes so far.  #travelswithcurtis
@DeltaAssist very classy. DL delayed 1642 serving pizza and drinks at Akron gate 5. Kudos DL
.@united You can and should do better: 'Fear of autism' forces family off plane http://t.co/QlHx7omA12  #autism
@P0TUS @Delta @DeltaAssist @KLM they are a terrible terrible airline.
@VirginAmerica two day with no service why do I even pay my phone?!
I've spent 2 hours on the phone with @VirginAmerica customer service because they cancelled my seat &amp; my pet reservation...worst airline
@united again. I've been sitting on tarmac for 40 mins still in Houston. Will miss my connection to London. Terrible service. Period.
@united 4 straight weeks of inability to deliver on promised flight arrival time. departure time and lost luggage. You #suck

In the rapid city airport waiting to leave for @dfwairport on @AmericanAir. Delayed for a ground stop at dfw. Sun &amp; 85 in dfw. What's wrong?
@AmericanAir flight 1169 ORD to LAX.  Cabin so hot and uncomfortable - no response to multiple customer requests to lower temp.  And more.
@JetBlue flight delayed... Delayed again... Now deplaned and waiting... @DeltaAssist would have rebooked already!
Departing almost 2 hours late. Glad I booked @AlaskaAir. #sarcasm #FlightDelays
been on hold 40 mins @AmericanAir. you cancelled and rerouted our flight and are now trying to upcharge our seats. would like to talk to you
@SouthwestAir shrinks flight options in and out of Spokane. Time to switch to @AlaskaAir credit card. #goodrunwhileitladyed
Disappointed in @United - bad customer service today. First flight landed late.missed my connection Plane still here but door closed. Grrrr
@united gee i wish i had a name for non-english speaking person with horrible cust serv skills. not my job to do your job there.
@united is by Far THE WORST AIRLINE to travel with.Nasty customer service..unprofessional and I will never fly with them again. Jetblue here
@AmericanAir Remember a month ago. you told me customer service would contact me about my issue I submited on Jan 3? Still no response!
@SouthwestAir Lost 1st Xmas gift my hubby gave me on fl 3505. BWI to DAL yesterday. #nexus72013 pink case Filed report. Pls help find it!! ðŸ™
@AmericanAir very frustrated.. Been sitting in LGA for an hour and they're saying that we don't have a plane bcoz Lightning struck? Lol
@DeltaAssist Any idea what the reason for the creeping delay on DL3681 is? Anything more detailed than "maintainence"?
Don't even remember the last time I flew @SouthwestAir without my flight being delayed 😒
All this $ for a early flight from Detroit and delayed hrs? I spend all this $ on my company flying and still no status. Tsk @DeltaAssist
Looks like @Delta @DeltaAssist owes @mattnathanson a little more than an apology for destroying his guitar. #notshocked
The concept of standby doesnâ€™t exist anymore. Itâ€™s just waiting to be charged $75. Wildly inefficient. Yeah iâ€™m looking at you @united
@AmericanAir worst experience ever at O'hare. Lots of ignorant people work for this air line. http://t.co/6TNPF24Vb2
@ItsNickBean @AmericanAir stop missing your friking flights 😂
Screens on @united 224 not working so the demo video isn't showing so we can't push back...smh
@united anyone want to respond to my complaint on lost &amp; opened luggage both to &amp; from my destination + this "joke" http://t.co/YGRF6t65UM
@united 612 delayed from #ROC due to a taxi light bulb lense being damaged.
@WeeklyChris @AmericanAir the airports must really hate you guyd .
@SouthwestAir you lost all 3 of our bags. claim agent at TPA said delivery 2nite. 888# agent says bags missing and was so rude.
@united been waiting for a gate at dca for over an hour with 2 children. Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir how is it your ground crew didn't notice our tire issue till the plane was fully boarded??? #1542 DFW
@SouthwestAir lost my luggage and turbulence was so bad I couldn't even use my drink tickets. Business select problems. No bag till Monday.
@JetBlue Once again JetBlue fails to deliver!
Viewer Scott tells says @SouthwestAir and @Airtran flights out of #midway cancelled until 7pm. #chicago @ScottRMiller http://t.co/x6clbEWgtW
Either the A/C or ground APU are not working tonight on @AlaskaAir flt 717. Pretty toasty in here #PaxEx
I detest @AlaskaAir!  Our flight was delayed. but gate agent assures us we can make it.  But now our flight has a faulty ignition!
@VirginAmerica on 13FEB I rcvd the email attached. In order to use the deal. I'd have to time travel #expired #fail http://t.co/MSrGhB4kXS
Here's a better view of the @AmericanAir 757 in new livery. No WiFi radome :-( http://t.co/j0JAbOpjHm
.@VirginAmerica I am not a happy customer. And I'm definitely not looking forward to my flight based on my treatment thus far.
Please please @JetBlue Say you aren't going to be like all the other horrible airlines. http://t.co/MWkoNqwp7E
@united help I'm stuck in Chicago and need to get back to New York!!!! #stranded
First flight delayed by 4 hours. Second cancelled. Now to wait 6 hours to get on a new flight @united needs to sort themselves out #sodone
@AmericanAir @jpromi2 yes Joe ORD isn't under their travel alert they are just canceling flights there. Your bad.
So unhappy with @AlaskaAir at the moment. Canceled flight. sitting for over an hour on the tarmac. switching planes...#NotAwesome
BOS/SFO Head to head 1A vs 3A @united much work to do spotty internet. power not working. so so food &amp; seats @VirginAmerica wins hands down
Please @AmericanAir don't make me miss my connect flight home! #BWIBound #Layover #FlightDelays
@anthonyladao @AmericanAir #Mivoto40midnightRed AmericanAir is sucks.
@united it makes it quite difficult to submit a delayed bag form when you just have a printable PDF on your website. Please change that.
And their trip frm Hell cont... Btwn @Expedia @AmericanAir dbl booked xcld flt less than 24 hr b4 rebook then lost at check in #expediachat
@united flight 698 from SFO to ORD sucks at turbulence announcements. Randomly yelling "check seatbelts!!" is terrifying.
@AmericanAir just flew you guys and it sucked ... You pay all this money but only a soda no more snacks ? Ridiculous
@eclarkdec14grad I have struggled w/ @USAirways customer service and reliability in the past &amp; switched to @SouthwestAir you should too!
@CNN @SouthwestAir @CNNTravel should never happen
@AmericanAir you are the worst airline in the world with the worst #customerservice  #NeverAgain
@united worst customer service ever. Missing Sonoma sun. wedding festivities&amp; din rez for 6 hour plane switch &amp; delay. Miss you. @jetblue
bang up job today @united. Delayed flight from boston to Newark strands about 15 passengers as they get to their connection to San Diego.
@united It's unfair that a One Day One Time Pass means you cannot leave Club but stay within 9 hrs for flight to Asia. Exercise / Food ????
@ArianFoster @united They are easily the worst. They delayed my bros flight by 13 hours after saying it would be a 1 hour delay initially
@SouthwestAir Don't ruin our vacation. Cancelled flight. over hour already waiting to get phone answered. Just rebook our flight!!!!
â€œ@L1LDebbie: The worst airlines @united never ever fly with them. They are unprofessional. rude. and lazy !!!â€ Damn I would say US Airways
@WWEAJLee @AmericanAir damn American Airlines. get your shit together
OK BASICALLY AFTER FIVE MANHATTANS AT THE AIRPORT BAR THAT PACK OF RITZ CRACKERS WITH CHEESE THEY SERVE ON @SouthwestAir IS FUCKING CAVIAR
Good thing I brought my own entertainment. @JetBlue #broken #boo http://t.co/luESgDJ089
@United awful gate. not enough seats. nowhere for boarding lines 😞 @ Newark Liberty International… https://t.co/IlD6MDIzTy
@JetBlue if you're deciding whether to cancel a flight. don't make us wait over 2.5 hours to give us a verdict
@AmericanAir First flight was delayed 40mins and then bag took 10mins...Woman at the gate in O'Hare denied me from boarding even though
@AmericanAir at JFK pls get it together...4hr delay and 2 gate moves so far (1 going back to prev gate). What's next?
@LA_Aviation @AmericanAir is the worst with handling cancellations and long hold times. She could've had them call her back though
@aadler1204 @jetblue we're used to taking the blame for EVERY delay.  Most savvy travelers know it's not *always* our fault.
@VirginAmerica you lie about singapore partnership. elevate not eligible for business class. no dates available. sales rep says it is a myth
@AmericanAir Your http://t.co/sZnHJZrWZb is having trouble submitting request and displaying confirmation screen. Very bad user experience.
@SouthwestAir. sev ppl im my office received an apology and 2k. FF miles for this delay. only apologize to select ppl? I got nothing..
@AmericanAir filed report with Avianca. Almost wasted trip. no time. especially no tools. No ones sure if I'll pass the bag going home.
@united @kristen Disappointed?  How about disgusted (!!) and you will fix this immediately
@AmericanAir confusion at gate for flts ELP-DFW. Was on with AA rep but got disconnected. Need help rebooking to avoid missed connect.

Normally I love @AlaskaAir but you guys are killing me right now. 3 hr delay. parts flown over from Honolulu twice. Still can't fix plane.
@USAirways 45 minutes...... @AmericanAir Your partner over here is making you look bad.
.@SouthwestAir makes it really hard for one to find their old travel funds. seems to be on purpose. #NotCool
Ah! @united re-routed us thru Chicago on a diff airline. Orig. plane is delayed and this is the only way we'll make connection to London.
Flew @AmericanAir dallas to uk last week and I'm shocked at the poor on board entertainment! Waiting 20 mins 4 a movie to start is so 2005!
Im NEVER flying @AmericanAir again. You guys have NO regard 4human life.It costs more money to cancel a ticket when a person damn near died!
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@united Really sucks that u keep some1 on hold for 15 min then when u start 2 ask a question u get hung up on Bad customer service #united

@AmericanAir tried us air and as mobile apps. Not working. Trying to check in for flight tomorrow
Ack! So frustrating @DeltaAssist. with the @Delta iOS app latest v 3.1.1: it crashes each time I try to view a SkyClub. I'm on a 5S. :-/
@mrdenny @united They sent it using the onboard wifi. its a bit slow.
Fuck JetBlue. #boycottjetblue #jetbluesucks @JetBlue  http://t.co/QNmsMLsngc
@united you are a joke.  Rude flight attendants on the DEN-&gt;YYC before even leaving and we are an hour behind.  Nothing is running smooth
@AndyTarnoff The past two @SouthwestAir flights that I've been on. they announced that the wifi was not working shortly after take-off. :/
2015 starts just like 2014: @united late on BOTH flights today. Unspecified baggage issues.
Time to retire another tired @united airplane. Flight 744 to Boston is still delayed and down on its luck.
.@SouthwestAir when shit gets turbulent. many. and i may venture. most. of your captive consumers actually require alcohol
@united I'm being offered a different flight. but do I want to wait another 5 hours on top of the 2 of delays that caused this? #waitformeee
@united help!  Cancelled flights and need new routing.  DM please
@ColleenB123 @SouthwestAir NOOOO That sucks!
Again @AmericanAir worst service ever I cannot believe I still used your services again! #worstcustomersercice #stuckinsfo
@AmericanAir - just found out you removed the app for @windowsphone.  Very disappointed and mad.  No official explanation either.  Why???
@sebroche @DeltaAssist @Delta do spn actors just have a tendency to get annoyed with airline companies
@eastindiayouth @VirginAmerica you are worse than Akai . Total failure in modern technology and competence . PS can I get an air miles card?

@AmericanAir y'all need to get your shit together at Dallas. canceling flights &amp; having only ONE person work the desk.
@united 4 days later. another airport. and I have to deal with more rude staff?? #shame
How is it possible to delay flights so that private plans can land first @united that is just dumb
@AmericanAir if I never fly with you again. it will be too soon
How is it that @SouthwestAir cannot tell me where my bags are. At 5 months pregnant and all my clothes being in those bags i am screwed
@SouthwestAir Can you help me cancel one leg of my son's round trip flight? RR# 20079070152. res # 8MI6QN. I'd like to cancel 4/19/15 flight

@SouthwestAir Yes-However. now home (not 1am) there are more items damaged then the PJ's. Can we itemize those on the email report? Photos?
“@48tweetsofpower: Master the art of timing.” Relevant bc of the three hour delay. @JetBlue
Fuck yourself @AmericanAir
Loving #FlyFi!  Too bad my @JetBlue flight seat doesn't have power like @SeatGuru told me it did. #inflightweeting #wompwomp
Hey @united can I get my money back ? Your airline is awful
@AmericanAir cancelled flight for tomorrow. now i am on hold for 20 minutes with the gold desk. Imagine if i didn't have status.
â€œ@ryan_villopoto2: I feel like switching airlines and never flying @united again" damn bro just get @KawasakiOnline to send a corporate jet

@AmericanAir do you have a support team for the Aadvantage program? Wait time on phone is 9+ minutes. Can I email a query?
@FrontierCare 😩😩😩 worst twitter customer service ever lol. why i love @VirginAmerica always so helpful
Hey @AmericanAir.  You are just the worst.
Pay @AmericanAir 100K @aadvantage miles PLUS $1400 on top of that... and all you get is "wait-listed" for 2 going to Europe?! #ripoff #miles
Hi @united I'm in a bit of a jam. my bag was lost earlier today and now 10 hours later it's still missing. I was hoping you could help me!

I've flown 6 legs from 5 diff airports on #deltaairlines in the past 2 wks. &amp; every single flight has been delayed. #worthless @DeltaAssist
@AmericanAir Want to piss off a USAir Chairman preferred. Promise them #firstclass and never deliver after 15 months of AA flights
Well @JetBlue. nothing validates my decision to breakup with you quite like a 5 hour wait in #JFK (cont) http://t.co/SJJcy5AE1f
@Americanair please open up a gate and get flight 78 off the DFW Tarmac and off this plane!
@DeltaAssist  @KLM if Flight 9357 left JFK 3 hours late and arrived in Amaterdam after a scheduled connecting flight to Munich. What happens
@AmericanAir cmon guys the flights shouldn't be shorter then the time I'm waiting for my bag!
If it's not weather delays it's maintenance delays. Some things #globalservices status with @united just doesn't fix.  #stuckinSLC #delayed
I just can't imagine a worst customer experience than what @united offers.The people know less than the display boards &amp; aren't able 2help!
@flyLAXairport womp womp. It would make @AmericanAir's usual delay of flights more bearable.
@united fuck you. Your airline is garbage and your service is even more disgusting. It'll only be a matter of time until you're bankrupted
Why is it taking @SouthwestAir so long to depart? More than a 45 minute wait on the plane. I feel like I'm on @USAirways.
2 out of 3 flights delayed for @AmericanAir. The last one caused a connection miss and now I'm missing a family event ðŸ˜¡ grrr
@United has tried their best to ruin our family vacation to the Bahamas... Absolute terrible logistics and customer service
I'm glad I fly @SouthwestAir! @united should be ashamed #unitedfortahera #IslamophobiaISREAL

@AmericanAir 4 days after a very serious complaint by my business and loss of lots of money. still no response from complaint team.
My favorite airline. @jetblue. killed my favorite suitcase. Had to buy a brand new one on day 1 of a 14-day trip! http://t.co/bl0ebPYFFU
@DeltaAssist rebooked to accommodate a delayed passenger; put back on my original flight only to have my bag lost at LAX and not go to PHX
@AmericanAir lost my moms luggage was supposed to be at tallahassee airport Monday and isn't no one is returning her calls #Disappointed
@DeltaAssist i am a business traveler and my agent books. Why is the experience so horrible?
@SouthwestAir  plane malfunction. Missed connection.  Pay for your own overnight accommodations? #dontflysouthwest
Going to miss elite with @AmericanAir by 400 miles. and the only option is to spend $400 for a "boost" - Time to start flying @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir :My checked in baggage didn't arrive .I am waiting since 5 hours as I have all my clothes in it!please help!
@AmericanAir  you are horrible.
No wonder people hate flying!@SeizingHope @AmericanAir
@SarahBlackwood1 @united who will be their passengers in the future? these little people. kids cry (and then fall asleep!). shameful.
@JetBlue you're a great airline. But hire new marketing people. Everyone hates pigeons. Makes me not like you because of your ads.
Whyyy are my flights delayed? @VirginAmerica
And I'm really irritated that every time I have to call in to work on this. each agent is telling me something different. @DeltaAssist
Does the combined AAdvantage/Dividend Miles program change the upgrade procedure for @AmericanAir elites on US or still wait till check-in?
I'm glad @united cancelled my flight with 1.5 hrs notice then charged me $400 to take another flight. #UNITEDSUCKS #DONTFLYUNITED
@lufthansa seems there is a system issue b/w u and @united &amp; no one wants to accept fault!! No reps can help.. I am stuck.. Please refund!!!
@AmericanAir over 4 hrs of delays. 3 gate changes flight 237 LAX to Cabo. Tired.  disappointed. Fix it!
Noooo!!! @AmericanAir Flight 51 from LHR&gt;DFW is no longer on the 77W?? That is the reason I booked that flight. wanted WiFi!!!

@smoot60 @AmericanAir that is a bummer Where did you miss flight?
@AmericanAir   Never again
@AmericanAir cancelled my flights 2x in 1 wk! JFK-YYZ on Wed and JFK-YYZ 9am today. Is rebooking me tomorrow aft to YYZ the best you can do?
Think twice before choosing @united Airlines. No ethics. tricky. misleading and irresponsible service @CBSNews
.@AmericanAir another week another 2+ hour delay AA0915 and incorrect info from app. As a former delta diamond i'm really missing @Delta
@DeltaAssist will call when I land - we have to figure something out. Unacceptable
@rritterr @JetBlue having no TVs on a flight is like having a flip phone.
@AmericanAir lack of communication switching to USair at LGA is about to make me miss flight despite having more than an hr btwn flights
@JetBlue same problem here.  Tried deleting and re-installing app and no luck.
@united resetting my online password shouldn't require this inconvenience. My federal clearance requires less. Can you assist?
Just bcos I am black you assume I cannot fly business class @DeltaAssist @Delta the ticket has been cancelled my flight leaves in 2hrs
@AmericanAir - You've got a big mess at LAX - flight 2865 "damaged?!?" Pls get a replacement plane here ASAP - people are getting irate!
Another lost bag by @united   At least you guys are consistent! #epicfail http://t.co/ToMbBVghii
.@OpenFairSkies haha. What a load of crap. @united @delta @AmericanAir have crappy products and service. Afraid of competition?
@SouthwestAir was terrible last night with the 3 hour delay.. Flight 597. Not the 1st time. How can I be convinced to ever take SW again?

@VirginAmerica flight has the wrong date and i'm supposed to fly in 3 hours. got transferred from kayak - seems like something broke. help!
@AmericanAir no. I'm sorry. It's been 96 hours. This is ridiculous and completely unacceptable. Get it together and fix this.
Hey @AmericanAir how can i change my reservation due to weather if i cant get thru on phone? ANNOYING!
My solution to @united Airlines since they like to leave animals outside. @PerezHilton @theregoesbabs @sia ... https://t.co/VLC5gETgUQ
@RagtagChris @SouthwestAir I fly Delta and US Air regularly. I never gave paid to carry on in my life.
Wake up somebody in the Montgomery baggage service office and have them send my bag bag to California now! Waiting so long! @AmericanAir
Worst customer service of all time:  1.  @Arhaus  2.  @united  3.  Lucifer
@united Captain runs late and I can't get home to my family...major fail!  #UnitedAirlines #fail
@united worst customer service @TorontoPearson
.@AmericanAir way to forget to schedule gate staff for our flight &amp; delaying us #nothappy
Our Russian corer never showed up in Miami. and @AmericanAir seems to have lost my students' frame packs on the flight from MIA to BOS (?!).
@JetBlue Worst online trying to book . what a waste time took 45 min to book a flight
@AmericanAir 1st flight. pilot never shows. 2nd flight. at boarding the FAs reported to C17 not D17. Way to keep ruining #ValentinesDay
@AmericanAir Bos. flight attendent tells me. after others use the br that I would cause the whole plane to be late if I went in? Wtf?
I am not looking forward to picking up my guy from his 3 hour delayed @SouthwestAir flight http://t.co/QUEzGhzxQf
@united any chance of info in UA005. my husband is just waiting while flight staff have taken their cases off and left. Seriously!!!!!
I cancel my @jetblue flights. and instead of an actual refund like it said. It was deposited into a "JetBlue Bank". Fuck JetBlue.
I'm not one to generally complain about this but this experience with @AmericanAir has been atrocious. Never again will I fly with them.
@iamwill I think @united hates you :(
@AmericanAir trying to get to #chi....what's the delay?
delay 2+ hrs bc high hydraulic fluid in plane from JFK where "it is colder than in SF"...has @AmericanAir never flown from NY to SF before?
@AlaskaAir it would be awesome if your app printed itinerary changes when there is a mechanical... Going to miss my flight today!
@united you better have someone check Facebook post of  hero Marcus Luttrell and the over 18000 negative comments re your airline.  #txfrog
.@united still waiting for response back from Customer Support @united as why my 4 month old was put thru a 'random' security check at #YYC.
@united trying for the last 30 minutes to book a ticket. Luckily @AlaskaAir will take my $ without issue.
@JetBlue follows the other airline cattle herders. More baggage fees. less leg room. more rudeness. etc... Nice going #JetBlue!
@AmericanAir Yes. but unfortunately not until the following day. which meant appointments and lodging reservations were lost
@AmericanAir What's the phone number for a USAir refund I was promised after y'all cancelled my trip halfway thru. and sent me home?
@AmericanAir Filed refund claim. sent multiple emails. NO RESPONSE. Site indicates refund made. but CC says it was not. AA black hole.
Was sick so couldn't fly @SouthwestAir. Husband called in 2 hours before flight time and phone support won't acknowledge the refund. Awful.
@eflind @JetBlue Ugh. So frustrating. I hate airports. they give me anxiety.
.@SouthwestAir it's time to invest in a seat reservation system. The herding of cattle is ridiculous.
@united my brother @RSFENCE is stuck in Newark airport. Missed 10:35 flight to Tel Aviv after flight from DC was delayed. Can you help?
@AmericanAir @elenascotti this sucks We have missed our flight to Ireland that leaves at 620 and now looking like we will miss the 9pm
@DeltaAssist Ever since you opened Sky Priority line next to PreCheck in ATL you've screwed up PreCheck. This is a mess!
@United United keeps dropping calls to avoid assisting us with rescheduling cancelled flight #6225. Need response asap.
Thanks @JetBlue for losing my luggage and ruining my Thanksgiving. Don't fly Jet Blue.
Trying to book flight on @AmericanAir &amp; their website is from the Apollo era! What a horrible experience.
@zanelamprey @AlaskanBrewing @AlaskaAir enjoyed a tasty brew (or two) on a flight just yesterday. Might need to switch my preferred airline.
@AmericanAir we are trying to do that now. Still on hold... 2hrs... 3 times today. Will keep trying http://t.co/ETOMB9D5eT
@united mechanical problems in Ontario. no hotel rooms in San Fran. currently enroute to Seattle. Hoping for a hotel room

@AmericanAir MIA Airport. Half an hour waiting at Business-Class check in. Ridiculous! Am I going to miss my flight?
@AmericanAir Awful that a member of our armed forces tries to change flight to be w/ her father battling leukemia and is told $500 or no.
@SouthwestAir what is the outlook for tomorrow's flights out of LAS to MDW. Been stuck since Friday and need to get back
@DeltaAssist My family with 12 week old baby had flight moved up. No notification. Missed flight. Now stuck in SLC until tomorrow.
@dangillmor Worse. it's a 4-digit pin @United reps HAVE ASKED CUSTOMERS TO DISCLOSE TO THEM!
@XxChasenxX @GlobeMetro @BostonGlobe @JetBlue that's irresponsible to keep people worrying and not saying anything.
@SouthwestAir is your website experiencing problems? Trying to book travel. radio buttons are very slow/unresponsive.
How is a plane that's spending the night in the airport delayed for its first flight of the day @AmericanAir?! 😡 #THISIsRidiculous
@united please don't let 3764 from IAD to MSY leave without us today! Lol. So late leaving YYZ on 5689!
@nickcarter @AmericanAir @Celina85 You hate me because You never answer me :(
@sidbyrd @united You mean post-Continental United's getting steadily worse? You don't say.
@united worst customer service. flights cancelled no reason. No help to get people home without extra costs to them. #unitedairlinesfail
@DeltaAssist  I missed my connection in ATL to IND only flight was to Chicago.  Can you have my bag brought to my hotel?
I know to never get a @united airline ticket. Hate to see how they would treat military members.
@AmericanAir  Your flight today was horrible. Bad service. small seats. flight delayed. nickel and dime for everything. ugh.... Help me!
Ohhhh @united I absolutly hate u and how ur airline is ran!!! I have nothing but problems EVERY SINGLE TIME I fly with u.
@DeltaAssist your jfk baggage loaders are way behind schedule.  1 hr delay!  @smw04 @
@SouthwestAir Folks. the Customer Relations line solid busy since 8 a.m. Eastern this morning. Have an issue we have to get resolved today.
@AmericanAir 3 agents to check in at LEAST 2 wide body aircraft out of EZE? Pathetic customer service and organization by your contractors.
@TheCobaltGuy @VirginAmerica Virgin America is my favorite airline and I've never yet flown it. And I have flown a LOT. around the world.
@AmericanAir What a mess! Flight from Vegas is late &amp; has to stop for gas in Dallas and no food except for the 5 first pass of coach!
Dont fly @AmericanAir if you want peace of mind. They check ur bag at the gate and write tags by hand . hopefully my bag s not lost
@AmericanAir bad start to a B-day trip to New Orleans. Original flight 1 hour late and counting. No solid reason why. #badstarttoagreatweek
@DeltaAssist @Gogo actually your crew said the "wifi was broken" leading me to believe it was a hardware issue. More broken on that plane 2.
.@AlaskaAir hey guys u lost one of my bags &amp; now I have to wear sweats for 2 weeks straight :-)
@united my entire trip was pointless now with a 4 hr and 25 min delay. Lost money and a major client because o
Never using @delta @DeltaAssist again-bunch of crooks. Buy a ticket &amp; then say there are no seats so I need to pay extra for comfort seats
@SouthwestAir mechanical. and not weather delays. is something I would expect from American. Flight 4371.. been roasting for an hour+ 😠
@AmericanAir just waited over an hour for baggage in Austin. Terrible customer service by AA.
@JetBlue no longer "above all" in pricing and service like it used to be. Bag fees &amp; tighter seats satisfy investors: http://t.co/esGgVTUDlT
The rudest ticket person I've ever experienced in my life. We will never fly southwest again as a group @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist Why Delta plains in Atlanta need deicing on temp. 35F and poring rain??? And being delayed because of it?
I'm on the phone w/ @united for 30min trying to get mileage I earned. Have a flight this week. about to cancel because they wont honor miles
@DeltaAssist left my Fitbit on plane. DL63 from Boston to London. Arrived this am. Lost and found? Mindy.harbeson@gmail.com
@united probably not..you guys lost my bag and really didnt put forth a real effort on finding it.
Never flying @united again unless they take accountability for the suffering they inflicted on that poor dog. http://t.co/7qCB6kVJgL #share
Seriously. @AmericanAir? We're going to miss our connection home because our plane is sitting 15 feet from the gate. #fml #holidaytravel
@DeltaAssist  I need assistance with skymiles and credit card partner programs due to issues with booking an international flight
Delayed @SouthwestAir flight may cause me to miss the last BART train home 😢
@jodiapplekay @RealMichaelKay @JetBlue im sure yr Hubby would say there full of it based on his delay other nite boy was he hottt Jodi ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Incredibly exhausted after a day full of delayed flights and lost baggage. Still don't know whether @united or @AmericanAir has my suitcase.
@curtbuthman @AmericanAir @MarshaCollier @Box_Pipe Getting bumped. unheld reservation. etc... among the very worst customer service fails
Delta's mechanical issues!  Going on 3 hours now for Delta to deal with an oil leak and a missing screw. Get your act together! @DeltaAssist
Had to cancel my flight to Austin. but @JetBlue is so awesome for their no hassle refunds. My Travel Bank account funded in seconds. ✈💰 🙌
@AmericanAir Do you seriously not have a transfer desk open in Hong Kong until 9 am? You have 4 #execplats waiting for 2 hours. Why?
@SouthwestAir we have been stuck in Chicago waiting for a gate for 40 minutes our flight time was an hour from kci - no communication?
@HollandTaylor @AmericanAir Yeah they should. Their service is abominable. Definitely should provide you with a meal of your choosing.
I wish someone would response at your offices and on your main number abt how yall lost my luggage @SouthwestAir
After being delayed for 1 1/2 hours on Sunday my @AmericanAir flight has now been delayed 1 hour again 2 days later. Last AA flight for me.
Sent you a DM @united . had a personal question/ issue arise!
@AmericanAir #1702 Boarded. 1 1/2 hours late. which is improvement over Wednesday. @SouthwestAir @JetBlue welcome to my preferred list.
Customer service is your goal? When its regarding a disabled customer its a responsibility. Shameful. @jetblue @americandisabilityact
@united  you really a very bad airline you took my family off the paint because you over book UA5588
@SouthwestAir was just notified my a.m flight from IND&gt;MCI cancelled. SW- not hv other options to get me there. Can you put me on @united?
@JetBlue was my fav airline. 2015 new fees/ reduced leg room is not cool. Looks like @SouthwestAir is my #1 #jetblue http://t.co/qrY84eKbNn
2nd attempt to leave @dsmairport. Unfortunately this isn't #heaven it's #Iowa. and life is calling.  Make it happen @united :)
Now thirty minutes late as @AmericanAir prioritise the entertainment system over the actual flying part of their business
@SouthwestAir did you cancel my 5:30 flight from LGA to MKE because you didn't sell enough seats?
@Delta and @SouthwestAir. I am very disappointed in my flights over the past few days. #CancelledFlight #delays #gatechanges #lastminuteprob
@AmericanAir and the orange priority bag tags came off way after other bags. Why bother maintaining that status if it doesn't work?
Hopefully our @united flight does not leave without us due to flight delay. UA51 EWR&gt; IAH
@brittbellgardt @AmericanAir  at least the problem occurred on ground and not up in the air..
So the wifi on this @United flight doesn't allow me to go on the @FreeOnes website. What the fuck is that?
So @AmericanAir totally botched my res w @British_Airways flight stuck where I really don’t want 2b. But... defaulting
@TRAGlCS @AmericanAir what the heck?!?! this is getting dumb ðŸ˜’
@SouthwestAir my wife's first plane was delayed but her second isnt. Now only 15 min between flights. Help!
Full plane of people stuck on the runway @flylaxairport @united
@AleSkye @AmericanAir they are not working.  They are ignoring all calls.
@TSAmedia_RossF hmm ... That's the issue?? All TSA employees and no airport/@DeltaAssist. Maybe we need #LessBlueShirtsMoreLeaders
@united playing hopscotch with us in Phoenix. Twice our gates changed. Hour late. Never again. Only @AlaskaAir &amp; @SouthwestAir from now on.
@JetBlue thanks to the not so great app. gate changed. missed our flight. Awesome!
@DoryuuShepherd @SouthwestAir That sucks so much man...I'm sorry
@stesparza1977 @SouthwestAir I'm flying Southwest on Monday to Atl. Delta has been decent. US Airways is so so but United's amenities suck
Another @united flight. another delay.  Sitting on the runway in this "extremely full flight".
@Gogo @AlaskaAir bad go go infl exp connected with phone then cant switch to tablet not clear since I've done the reverse 60 min wasted
@united When a flight is delayed with mechanical and crew issues you company should award MILES! #delayedagain
@madflavor @AmericanAir AA is the worst! Go spirit or southwest or virgin or a hot air balloon. anything is better than AA
Been here since 9:30AM PT. @United flight to SBA was cancelled. (@ San Francisco International Airport (SFO)) https://t.co/yLmILE2WO1
@ThisIsPVRIS @united ugh. They do provide the WORST customer service.
(1/2) I have family in India who are adopting a child. The embassy issued an early Visa for them to leave ASAP because... // @united
Never wil never fly @SouthwestAir again When U R 2 open at 4:30am ur employees shouldn't be rolling up at quarter to 5. Get ur shit together
@AmericanAir stuck at JFK for Christmas. Missed the 1pm to DC by minutes. Talked to 3 american employees for assistance- all contradicted
Soo... @united blocks access to weapons manufactures. And with that. they have lost my business. #2a #MOLONLABE http://t.co/6QJswa6Qux
Really confused why my @SouthwestAir flight ISN'T cancelled yet into DCA. It's the capital of snow city there! #impatient #stayingorleaving
@SouthwestAir what's happening with flight 3680 to Bur? 2nd time I'm delayed again flying southwest  in 2 days??!
Has the @AmericanAir B787 flight to @manairport been cancelled? Doesn't appear to have departed DFW yet....
Premier Access security line is longer than regular. The @united credit card is officially not worth it. #EricAndKevAreInLV
@JetBlue hopefully Yall don't cancel my flight for tomorrow
@AmericanAir waiting 2 days for a call from customer service. To everyone in the entertainment industry beware. The have WORST cust svc
Leave it to @AmericanAir to land early -  only to have us sit 300 feet from the terminal and stare at it for 30 minutes. @dfwairport
@united unfortunately this operations error caused me to miss my flight and now have a 6.5 hour layover -unacceptable!! #nothappy
@united you guys are the worst! Left my underage sister stranded with no hotel or ANYTHING. Very ANGRY customer. #douchebags
So thanks @AlaskaAir for completely SCREWING me!!! I made it to the gate and the door was STILL open and they wouldn't let me on! #NotCool
@AmericanAir disappointing lost baggage policy; my bag sat 9 hrs at the airport and no one called me- tracked it down on my own 👎💼
@AmericanAir   The bad attitudes of the gate staff and flight crew is getting old!
VERY unhappy with service I got from @AmericanAir . Worst is that they don't seem to care at all despite several attempts from me. Avoid!
@SouthwestAir THIS IS THE WORST AIRLINE EVER GONNA TELL ME I HAVE 2DRIVE 6 HRS 2GET MY BAG R U SERIOUS RITE NOW ??? WANT A DAM REFUND
@united ANOTHER delay caused us to miss connecting flight. Now renting a car to get home. WTH?!
@united I requested window seat when I reserved my ticket but got a center seat when I checked in via mobile app. Buggy app? #annoyed
@MattLoveless @SouthwestAir or else we switch to Delta! Cue dramatic music.
@DeltaAssist was scheduled to leave MSP at 10:05 am for ATLANTA then on to KIN this afternoon. Flight delayed to this evening
@SouthwestAir u just cancelled my flight  857.  FEG3W3.  I'm with my 3 little kids wife and parents.  Can u get me on another flight?
@united your airline kept my mom and I waiting for hours before canceling your flight. Not only did you ruin our connection to Dubai..
@united shame on you for leaving that dog out in the rain!!!! I will make sure I never fly with you!!!
Do you know how long flight 3372 to Allentown. PA is delayed for @united
Fuck you @united u shitty Fuck bags. I hope your entire business gets chlamydia
.@united delivery window for misdirected luggage is longer than the window to set up cable tv.
How does a customer get refunded @Expedia when you charge them for 4 @AmericanAir tickets instead of 2? #CustomerExperience  #nothappy
WTF? God bless your heart.  shame on you @united. Sit that employee down on several sits Wth is that fuckery? http://t.co/YBkDNiitwj
@internauta2009 no sabia que @AmericanAir iba a MAD en B757... @AlbertoPajaroto @fdeaguilaramat @MadridSpotter @El_Neyra @VolarEsPasion
@united You have damaged my baggage (twice on 2 flights) and I cannot find an email address to contact you from the UK. Help me!
No matter how early you are flying. if it's @united there will always be a delay #fail UA4700
@united done. I've been on hold for 2 hours :(
Wow. Guess I'll never get to fly @JetBlue now. #travel #ttot #airlines  #airlineprices http://t.co/GsX7EDxECw
@JetBlue Are other people having problems checking in &amp; getting their boarding passes on the app? I've been trying all day. but not working
@DeltaAssist Terrible #1731 - no GF meal onboard. rude attendant. broken entertainment system. delayed. $1500 in first class. Not pleased!
@camerondallas @AmericanAir ANSWER HIM OR ILL KICK YOU IN THE THROAT
Bag destroyed at Sacramento baggage. @SouthwestAir has me covered w duffle &amp; will get me new Tumi bag http://t.co/BxLq5lKoXG
On this shit show of a day @JetBlue has 1 person available to help. Cmon man step up your game
@AmericanAir @tommcgrathnet You're not working hard enough - you've got some pissed EXPs on 398
@SouthwestAir horrible 3.5 hour delay flight 341 BWI-ATL. On/Off the plane 3 times and we're still at the gate!!!!!
And the worst part about it is. at least so far. @united has not offered her any sort of compensation. Definitely not weather related.
@AmericanAir since the merger this has the worst exp ever!
I have an urgent change on my reservation that can't be done online--phone says I have to wait two hours. Please help @AmericanAir
@united I'm appalled at your lack of action for Tahera; the utter racism she faced was awful. and you know it. #unitedfortahera
@TheBiancaDelRio @VirginAmerica @Virgin Queens don't fly coach!!! Raise. Hell.
@DeltaAssist #fail #epic #fail Your customer care is closed today even though I was requested to contact them today. #noreply on tweets :(
Oh @DeltaAssist I hate you. Don't tell me that I have to check my bag because it doesn't fit when I already showed you it did &amp; I'm zone 1.
Return to the airport... Are you kidding @AmericanAir highly inconvenient... An absolute joke!
@DeltaAssist red and blue tennis shoes missing from suitcase. can you help?
@DeltaAssist delayed on flight 1149 are there any alternative flights tonight? lax to hnl
@SouthwestAir  DELAYED MY FLIGHT AGAIN. This is 4/5 flights that have been delayed in the last 2 months. and for a full two hour delay!!!
Never flying @AmericanAir ever again.
"@ConferringCarl: Outrageous bad service &amp; bad communication by @AmericanAir in Dallas tonight. Shameful treatment of travelers." Ugh! Awful
@united been stuck on plane at LAX for almost an hour. Flights been delayed for two hours due to incompetence. The plane is at least 80/90Â°
Hey @VirginAmerica I love you guys. but you have a problem with counter service at LAX.
Unfailing consistency! Aeroflot of America (aka @SouthwestAir) experiences ANOTHER delay. This time. no email notification at all.
NO @PATHTrain running to/from #WTC; 40min wait for cab to airport; arrived 15 min before flight; delayed 2hrs onboard @united... #ButIMadeIt
@SouthwestAir seriously fuck you and your fucking airline. Every single time I fly with you I am delayed.
Being a Gold member has its benefits I guess. unless you have been on hold with @AmericanAir for over 2 hours #hiremore #makebillions
@united has created a boarding mess... Learn from @SouthwestAir
@united I understand that employees can be put in stressful situations but some of your staff are by far the rudest I've ever seen. #UA1180
@DeltaAssist Since the power just failed after we already waited an hour on the runway for a "lost bag". how 'bout you get us a new plane?
@DeltaAssist never flying delta again! Now I can't get back to college in time for my exam
Except when their jacked up codeshare arrangement with @AmericanAir for award travel screws up my Sundays haha https://t.co/EpIiiEgpNb
@AmericanAir so. so tired of the bait/switch "The flight(s) or fare selected is no longer available.â€ when booking thru your site.
@JaydenJaymes @Delta @united truly my babe they sucks!!!!!!!!! Hope you're ok get out of there soon babe
@JetBlue u can always hope__but its not looking good. #jetblue #justlikealltherest #HelloVirginAmerica!
@VirginAmerica I've had super frustrating 24hours trying to work with you b/c you were my fav airline but might rethink that now #frustrated
The flight 1116 of @united to San Francisco has been waiting for over an hour with all the passengers on board and we can't depart This suck
@united just spent over 90 mins on hold. just to get hung up on twice!! http://t.co/vCDOLfjn9K
@AmericanAir your mobile app is not working. I can't sign in it can't connect
@united Hmmm. This is business class?  I miss flying @Delta   NRT-ORD. Better business class.
@united UA3732 over an 1.5hr delay due to aircraft departing late? Really? Service continues to disappoint. esp after losing our hub!
@united is far worse.  https://t.co/eEIjifXcG7
â€œ@Pastor_Camp: Flight got delayed ðŸ˜‘â€ @AmericanAir
Three important things: 1) flying first class is not bad. Not bad at all. Thanks. @virginamerica!
@IIJERiiCHOII @VirginAmerica seriously? what the fuck is wrong with them if they tell you what the no. you can call them and get them done
@united after 25min wait i got hung up on. Now im on us airways. They can get me to vegas at a decent time. U fail #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir  American eagle as envoy air flights are like riding in a #hunkofjunk #horrifying shameful to charge what you do!
@united playing who's on first. Nobody knows why they can't board us. Then can. Then can't. Unhappy employees make unhappy customers.
@VirginAmerica on standby 4 LAX after missing my 1st flight by 1 min. 6 months pregnant and not guaranteed a seat on next flight. help!
@XXXMelissaMay  Make sure you get a refund. Don't let @AmericanAir screw you
@DeltaAssist cuz of the issues I have 4 trips on 1360 and 1 on 2528. I am flying out on 1360 but only need 2 seats. I need to be refunded.
@AmericanAir We've been sitting on the Tarmac for an hour waiting for a gate. AA199. Might want to have someone help. http://t.co/s7DAMo4SP9
everyone in this three hour delayed plane smells. I am not alone. #solidarity CC @AmericanAir
@CUGoose @united To annoy you before they cancel it ðŸ˜‰
@SouthwestAir Paid for early bird. Flights in 18 hours. no conf or boarding pass. On hold w/res. disconnected after 30 min. Help!
@DeltaAssist I have. The annoying thinking is that I did you a favor and then this happens to me. All my medicine is in the bag
If @VirginAmerica spent as much money on staff as they did on their safety video. folks wouldn't be missing flights. http://t.co/a1I4QEyIPu
Ugh I swear I'm only flying @VirginAmerica from now on. American airlines has too many delays 😶
@AmericanAir when you cancel a flight. please have more than one person on hand to manage rescheduling. This is ridiculous.
Guy checking boarding passes was so rude to older couple. Needs a little attitude check especially with SW credit card holders@Southwestair
Will never fly @united ever again!
@JetBlue You were my favorite airline but this news about baggage fees and cutting legroom makes you just like all the others. Bad decision!
@rayfawkes @united that sucks Ray! I hope it all works out fast!
@united you guys were supposed to let me know where my bag is every six hours cause you lost. Where the hell is it
@AmericanAir yeah bullshit. You've been saying that for years. Just admit you couldn't care less about South American routes
@turnbullben @Travel_Codex @RunwauGirl @AmericanAir I'm all for airline auxiliary revenue streams that don't end up screwing the passenger.
@AmericanAir wife gets 2x ear infection AA to charge me $2400 change fee to delay flight for family.  700k miles for naught.  Moving on.
@SouthwestAir Scree u. You treat people with allergies so poorly that I will never fly ur airline as long as I live.
Sigh.  Another delayed flight from #UnitedAirlines  why oh why? @united  this has become the standard... Or am I just this #unlucky
@JetBlue is there anything that can be done about changing a flight before the storm without a ridiculous fee?
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica Aww!! Losing you underwear is never a good thing. Look for a @Target _
@SouthwestAir sucks! Flight cancelled and then they said they couldn't get my cooler. so I asked someone else and they got my bags! Horrible
3 hour delay ok. Bad communication from gate staff and no crew not ok. @united. (@ Gate C90 in Newark. NJ) http://t.co/k8UabvTVBw
@AlaskaAir cancelled flight because pilot wouldn't land. But other airlines flying into Seattle just fine. Not ok!
@kristen  @united this is TERRIBLE!  #BYEKeith #gowithFelicia
I'm gold status on @AmericanAir and always amazed at how rude their flight attendants are for no apparent reason. #LearnToBePoliteAndSmile
“@AlaskaAir: @MissVerdict Hi there. no free drinks but they are reasonably priced. -John” lies!!! I got a free drink 😎
@AmericanAir nope. we couldn't wait forever. so we're renting a car &amp; driving home. #notevenanicetry #thebaggagebettermakeit
@SouthwestAir do you guys always mess up your early morning flights departing from TUS?
God. #southwestairlines and their poor service never ceases to amaze me. How are you still in business? @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir please respond to my direct message.  i need assistance as ill misconnect and be stuck in dallas
Another mechanical delay @united   What is going on?!  A mechanical delay is now as common as an on time departure.  Frustrated GS flier!
@AmericanAir stuck in MIA. family emerg FLT2312 sat for 1 hr baggage claim flat out refuses to look for bag so we can drive to Birmingham.
@AlaskaAir start charging more for airline tickets and start checking bags for free - boarding the plane experience sucks right now!
@deltaAssist @delta if you have a pet policy it should apply to all pets. someone in first class has it on their lap. Fl 2611 # unfair
@DeltaAssist Just curious. which gate/terminal does my flight AF0069 leave LAX this afternoon?
@AmericanAir Unfortunately I'm dealing with @united and they are truly the most outdated. horrendous. rudest carrier on the planet! #overit
@cmkshama @AlaskaAir @DangeRussWilson Russell. U should feel ashamed supporting an airline that can not even pay a living wage!!!
â€œ@DjRonChi: Yo @AmericanAir I gotta problem in Miami with one of your employeesâ€lol leave ppl alone
@SouthwestAir Really disappointed in the lack of communication and bad experience today.
@Delta @DeltaAssist shoutout to Donovan Stanton. who mailed me my leatherman after I arrived too late to check a bag. Delta is number 1!
@Delta @DeltaAssist could Your help me with my issues .. I've been calling since then. but they have not given me a solution to my case. 2/2
LOLOL "to ensure an on-time departure..." ooooookay @united. If this plane is more than its already 8hrs late. it's on you. #unitedairlines
Hey @united it's 2015 and you're still overbooking and delaying. Get it together guys.
My flight outta San Diego was delayed. I missed my connection in Dallas &amp; I'm stuck in Texas for the night. Word. @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist Need help with lost luggage. Medicine in suitcases. Nearly 2 days. No response from VA. Travel started with DL.
Hey @united get it together. Port Columbus airport having serious computer issues. #terrible #tooslow #needmorestaff #waitingoveranhour
@Alyssa_Milano @AmericanAir made me dump over 50oz in CUN.security said they would allow it if AA agent appvd. No response from AA cust serv
I'm extremely disappointed in @SouthwestAir and the way they treated my aunt and my 8 year old cousin. So disrespectful and unprofessional.
Bought a first class ticket for my mom. Cancelled it. And now being told we can't use any of the left over value. @AmericanAir is a joke.
@united had it downloaded then deleted &amp; got Americans bc your flight got delayed like 8 hours
@united is there any way to contact lost &amp; found quickly? Lost a pair of glasses coming into Newark airport this morning.
@AmericanAir I have been loyal to you &amp; you just suck tonite.  I can't stand gate agents with an attitude.  #Platinum #pay4myowntix
@united FYI. it's been almost a year and I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM YOU. This is why I no longer fly United.
@VirginAmerica new website can't connect to their old dB. Lost my reservation. Customer service can't figure out their own system.
@KDENZDV_Feeds @united Wasn't there. but I'm guessing the 'get to the melting point' and way it was communicated by crew contributed. #shame
@united you lost my bag two flights in a row - worst part is you made me gate check it this time
@united You always have problems with your airline and the worst costumer service.Me and my family will not fly with you again.
Welp. that's a first. @AmericanAir . captain is missing! Waiting to board for 40 min already. Grr #bahamas bound #mia http://t.co/NH6RDhIel3
@SouthwestAir Missing flight. need to rebook for next flight
@ZachHonig @united There is poor compensation! Last time happened to me it was 25K with AA.
@JustinNFJK @AmericanAir  oh  fuck
500k miles with @SouthwestAir last year and never ever again.
My weekly reminder that @united will NEVER. ever. ever try to resolve your issues or get Ur biz back. Fly @JetBlue
Just heard abt @drinkwaterevent getting kicked of @JetBlue for using social media?Would love an explanation #JETBLUE http://t.co/6HHfUZ6Mr3
@JessMeuse @Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom Hate that when that happens !
. @USAirways merger sucks.  @AmericanAir seats are horrible and service is not what I'm use too. Here I come  @UnitedAirlines.
@AmericanAir this happened more than a year ago and every letter you send and phone call said it was my fault that your employee stole fr me
@JetBlue Welcome to the "Just Another Shitty Airline" club. http://t.co/KgLDeyz7gl
Always a bummer to be delayed on the Tarmac. But hey. safety first and @JetBlue has TV. Also Clueless is on. http://t.co/QdvFQH9zzt
@KeeganAllen: RT @chrisdelia: .@united you are the fucking worst. Who runs your airlines? Cats? I fly all the time. I ONLY have problems ...
Missed my @united cnx @ #ORD #TSAsucks. On the next very full flt with dreaded center seat to #SFO. Already missing my @SAS plus experience.
@SouthwestAir I am pissed! U delayed my flight 7hours now it's 1am &amp; my 4yrold is screaming cuz he's so sleepy &amp; Atl trains not running!
@AmericanAir too bad you don't give $15 credits like @JetBlue when a food mistake is made.
#NotCool @TSA just took away my @MoetUSA @ChandonUSA 187 ml mini bottles. I had to throw them away. #NotHappy @AlaskaAir
And over an hour wait for baggage at EWR @united ?? Exhausting and disappointing end to a 24 hour travel day.
@DeltaAssist my bag has been missing for 12 days. what are yall gonn do
@AmericanAir another delay for aa1218.  3 out of 4 weeks the past month having mechanicals.
@DeltaAssist still waiting to hear back from Delta. Paid for an upgrade window seat and got a switch-a-roo middle seat
Dear @SouthwestAir @JetBlue and @Delta don't allow @HobbyAirport to rip off passengers with $5 luggage carts #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I have been on hold for over 3 hours.  #worstcustomerserviceever
If this delayed flight to Hawaii doesn't leave soon I'll be rooting on the Bears from 30.000+ ft. up! Come on. @united!
@united  apparently ORD has lost an entire plane load of luggage? UA1240 past 30 min and no bags...
@AmericanAir just had to exit the plan due to a problem with the door. I hope I don't miss my connection at DFW!
@AmericanAir @lpickos you are the most terrible airline ever!!!!!
@JetBlue No one flies on a holiday weekend?? @ #laguardia @ 7am for a 9am flight to FL. Flight delayed 2hrs -sitting in an empty airport.
.@AmericanAir doesn't seem like the weather was an issue for other airlines. @united just got me out of Dallas and into Chicago smoothly
Never flying with @united again. The employees are incompetent and the airline has no respect for its customers.  @SouthwestAir here I come.
@DeltaAssist how long does it take 2 get a refund caused by a flight cancelled twice and a delay on the third one that caused conexion lost?
@MbasuCNN @amnesty let's be serious for a sec.. @AmericanAir  lost my luggage a few weeks ago. Can you make them find it?
@JetBlue so disappointed. It is chaos in JFK. Not fare to take LGA as first priority before us. #trulydisapointed #hiremorepilots
After queuing up for takeoff here at ORD. @united is sending back to the gate for a "Maintenances Issue." Sigh... #mcaTravelsMaintained
@DeltaAssist my flight was pushed back 2 hours. no one let me know. and the treatment from representative and manager at ohare was terrible
@dickfundy oh fuck dude. @united return the bags or you will be forced to kneel before Zod.
@united way to go. Cancel the flight after 6 hr delay &amp; hold bags hostage for 18 hours. Top notch customer service guys. Top. Notch. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Ž
@DeltaAssist Hey guys. any chance you can tell me what's doing on with DL5807 besides "its delayed?" No plane. no announcement no agent.
@DeltaAssist-Unhappy Traveler at JFK. 9 AM to 2:30 PM departure = lost vacation day. Make it better? http://t.co/anT85wdKW1
@DeltaAssist we haven't been able to get information as to reimbursement.  I know the corporate office is closed but we lost a whole day.
How did this happen again? Flight delay &amp; mechanical problems @SouthwestAir the same thing happened last time I tried to fly from Boston ðŸ˜ª
Flying to Kona. Waiting on pilot paperwork. 26 minutes behind so far. @SouthwestAir maybe you should give @united some tips. #travel
@AmericanAir -mechanical issues on ancient plane. delayed to 8:30 pm. sat on the tarmac for over hour. all we got was H2O+ granola bar.
.@AmericanAir the six minutes i will miss my connection by as a result of the ground crew forgetting to empty the toilets will be shitty :(
@MarkBallas @AmericanAir @dylan_chambers Hey @AmericanAir you need to find Dylans luggage.  This is unacceptable.
@VirginAmerica thx for cancelling VX902 with no notification. i was already in the airport waiting like an asshole.
@VirginAmerica worst inflight service ever! Not UA low. but an order of magnitude worse than the usual delight I've come to expect. #VX027
WHOA... When the hell did @JetBlue ditch the @GolfChannel? This is a goddamn travesty!!!!!
First trip on @SouthwestAir will be my last. 2 hour delay?? Should have gone Delta. Awful terminal too. :-(
These airlines (i.e. @JetBlue &amp; others) kicking people off for tweeting and coming up with bogus explanations is ridiculous! #bad #custserv
@SouthwestAir F#280 😯✈😓 maintenance issues. can we just have a new plane?
Ouch. Gonna suck to fly WN tomorrow. And next week. MT @jonostrower: The 128 737-700s account for about 20% of @SouthwestAir's total fleet.
@DeltaAssist @delta I'm astonished you guys messed that up...that bad. Said it would arrive today and still didn't put it on the flight.
@DeltaAssist my flight is 2 hours delayed... I need to find an alternate connecting flight
.@united. I use you guys all the time. big supporter. But your group line system adds way too much stress. So much easier before.
@AmericanAir It's been over 9 days now and now has emailed or called me. Unacceptable business practice.
@DeltaAssist I've had 2 flights delayed a total of 7 hours today. This is more than ridiculous. You could say I'm unhappy with your airline.
@DeltaAssist FT 2275 what is up???? Late take off. diverted to Detroit. sitting on a plane for 2 hours now!!!
Still sitting at the gate. Flight scheduled to take off at 11:14. email from @united saying it was delayed received at 11:13. #obviously
@SouthwestAir My flight 1714 ISP to MCO (FRC8HZ) has been delayed for almost 2 hours. To make things worse theyve said its a technical issue
@JetBlue what's it take to get a call back from JFK lost and found?!
glad i'm not the only one that now makes an effort to avoid flying @AmericanAir horrendous new product. http://t.co/KFrtp1n8Bp
_ @VirginAmerica  Does loyalty have you stuck in 1986? Break free and score up to 7.500 Elevate po...: Does l... http://t.co/nCJDHlrFAL
#IAH RT @JADubin5: The pilot landed in Houston at 11:25. we boarded. been waiting ever since. @united doesn't know where he is. Seriously.
@AmericanAir Over an hour departure delay and counting for a broken seatbelt? Seriously?
Cancelled because crew didn't show. Get ALL THE WAY outta here @AmericanAir

@dannysullivan @SouthwestAir Oh you mean like @united Wifi?  Also a waste.
@AmericanAir idiots!!! Sitting in already delayed aircraft. They've lost their catering truck.

@VirginAmerica Another day and still no response from @CathayPacific about why they haven't paid me the $200 compensation they promised.
@united airlines has to be the absolute worst airline I have ever taken. It's one problem after another. never again.
@travelocity I spent over 3 hours on the phone with you on Sat trying to resolve an issue with @JetBlue ...but you never call back :(
@SimonettiLauren @JetBlue that stinks I planned on flying with them next year.. maybe not...
@salongirl03 thrilled to see you landed for Kate's wedding.but are you serious @JetBlue lost your bag?!?! Did they say when you'll get it?!
My flight showing on time. but another delayed flight shows departing only 20m earlier at same gate. Huh? No updates. no info @AmericanAir
Hey everyone. let's help Ginny Foxworth with her lost luggage claim! @Americanair won't) http://t.co/u163xJlKi7 via @elliottdotorg
Do not fly American Airlines! Their kiosk was not working and caused us to miss our flight....@AmericanAir @united

AA flight 1412 delayed 2 hrs for part being driven down from LAX. What about doing that last night. duh typical @AmericanAir #goingforgreat
@DeltaAssist i have flown 6 times and all 6 times i have been delayed...

@EricaVarley98 @AmericanAir and I met one of your employees they hate it too
Well thankful that this 7 hour screaming baby flight with the nonexistent FlyFi @JetBlue boasts about is over.
@Localite_LA @LAwonders not even any sort of notice or compensation. Too bad. we used to love flying @JetBlue come home! @jessbutl
@AlaskaAir Huge fail on your company's policy for a dying parent. especially when we've had our tickets and only want to move them up... :(
@DeltaAssist DM2616597916 on DL3976 sitting for deicing for hour? Connect to DL1687 at risk which I can't miss! Priority gate escort please.
Smh @united u guys smashed my suitcase wheels... Got a lil crippled suitcase now... Upset 1k member 😡😡😡
@united I had a terrible experience this morning and missed a meeting bc my flight got messed up #ridiculous
@AmericanAir A stewardess told a passenger to "just take it" when we haven't been allowed to leave the plane for the last hour and a half.
@DeltaAssist my wife and i had red eye cancelled tonight out of SJC. Her flight rebooked for tomorrow morning. I’ve not got confirmation
$25 short b/c @united decided you can't squeeze your bag into that ridiculous metal box that in no way resembles an overhead compartment.
@Mirindacarfrae best $300 we ever spent...added bonus we got to wait in the baggage service line for 40 minutes! @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist why is 4022 delayed? No one here to say and nothing on the email/ website
@AmericanAir @nickcapra quit screwing up his flights! He's a busy man
I hate the Blackhawks not because they're from Chicago but because they play at United center and @united is a garbage airline
@DeltaAssist Hi. I need help with my flights. I left Boston after a 4 hour delay and will miss my connection to Bangkok. what are my options
@united There is an issue with your site- Mexico departure tax is duplicated multiple times on flights from DC causing price to increase.
@AmericanAir I tried that...USELESS during the weather issues.
@united how is it you can land on time after a 13 hour flight and have no gate available? Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir why I gods name is this airline getting so careless. that pasngers sitting at the gate for three hrs. Is they no one to fix
I demand someone from @united to contact me. You're making me miss my friends wedding. Should've flown @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir flight aa3066 cancelled can i get a little help #littlehelp #2ndtweet
@JetBlue how can I confirm my flight is cancelled?
Shame on @SouthwestAir. Cancelled flt &amp; never told me. Used 2 B my fav. Cant rely on 4 biz travel.  #growingpains #notinLUV #firsttoworst
@AmericanAir are definitely the rudest airline I've ever flown with. hilarious to see they've given themselves the hashtag #GoingForGreat
@AmericanAir They have said the bins were full both times. The bag isn't the issue. it's the gate agents.
@united after 72 min on hold after my flight was delayed &amp;then not being helped because the agent kept forgetting my info-I'm on @AlaskaAir
Disgusted with the customer service from @DeltaAssist They lost my suitcase 7 days ago and I can't do anything for 45 days?! #awfulservice
Last 3 times I've flown @AmericanAir I've had a +4 hour reroute and luggage lost twice. #HatTrick
@united awful customer service @united
@americanair horrible service tonight on AA3201 ORD to BNA
Me and @peterknox . just two dudes. driving around the tarmac on an @AmericanAir flight. never leaving JFK. just cruising around.
@AmericanAir my 2 flights were cancelled yesterday. Was rebooked to today. Now I notice u bumped me down to couch from 1st on them all. Why?
Currently experiencing a 3 hour @united delay from ord to lax. My worst with them was 4.5 hours. What's been your worst delay?
We landed 15 minutes early and we're now 10 minutes late. Still waiting on a gate. WTF. @AmericanAir?
@AmericanAir Yay. my flight was cancelled!!!  I can sleep in a bit!  :)
@AmericanAir Why wasn't flight 356 out of DFW cancelled? We hit 2 storms.Worst flight EVER! Poor judgment! NEVER flying AA again! #travel

@AmericanAir waiting on maintenance to sign log book #delayed #flt158 #canwepleasetakeoff
Jesus @united get your shit together. No pilots = 3 hour delay. Worst experience ever. #neverflyunited
@JetBlue needs to start paying more attention to the business traveler because @USAirways is awful
@united you are the worst airline on earth!!! Are you aware of what happened???? #UnitedAirlines http://t.co/S1n7pT6fAa
@united will never fly United again. After 12 hours. flight was cancelled due to a poorly built airplane. Paid an additional $ for a ticket.
@AmericanAir is the worst they can't even merge their own airlines (us) to book a flight properly...
@JetBlue my plane is delayed is there anything you guys can do to past the time
@AmericanAir I was supposed to get a refund for flight 1074 on March 23rd - it was canc. on hold 42 minutes. any tips? Refund hasn't hit
@PHXSkyHarbor waiting on tarmac on @SouthwestAir 159 for over 30 min b/c of #SB49 private plane traffic
@DeltaAssist I was on the DL295 earlier today which was delayed. Counter staff told me new flight is 8am but when I log
@omarsuleiman504 @JanksTheMan @united This is awful :( The man who said that to her is a fucking bigoted scumbag.
@united you're officially the worst! I fly without issue except with you. 90 mins late now in a sauna of a plane. Why!?
@AmericanAir Complete ineptitude in handling flights and pathetic customer service @HarvardBiz @BBCtrending @nytimes
There's no one at the fron desk to even ask why it's delayed! Bad business practice @AlaskaAir
@JetBlue @jaaabeee meant to reply earlier. That was helpful. it did leave earlier.
@AmericanAir why is your wait times so grossly underestimated? I gave up after waiting on the for over an hour despite AA saying 5-8 minutes
@united: Things to hate about flying United Economy #1: can't open laptop all the way because seat is too small.
Just signed up for a @united credit card. too. Guess I won't be needing that now. since I'll never book with them again. @Delta from now on!
@AmericanAir Impossible to get to a human being at AA. you took our money. but U fucked us at the gate in Las Vegas. u need a class action
@SouthwestAir decision about nashville flights tomorrow yet?  All flights out cancelled today
Longer odds on a @united flight that's actually on time or mayweather tweeting a losing ticket?
@United Flew on United 3891. We were all sent to Supreme. now waiting in long line with no United reps around at Supreme. WTF is this?
2 cancelled flights with no notification. &amp; sprinkle a 45 min on hold call to @AmericanAir with no answer. Help us out #americanairlines ðŸ˜
@MDGonzales @ctrent @united that's a lot of screwing.
@DeltaAssist flight delays from JFK to Minneapolis are making me miss my connecting flight to FLL tonight..very upset I can't make it home
Both @united and @USAirways are on my shit list today
@united you guys are the worst. And I'm never using your services again
I hate flying @united I'd rather have a root canal without anesthesia. #AlwaysDelayed #Frustrated #ShootMePlease #LostLuggageAgain
@AmericanAir Disappointed with my last trip. Canceled flights. rerouted trips. carrier changes. non-working entertainment across Atlantic.
@Delta @DeltaAssist Been on hold for 6 hours trying to book a ticket someone please help! At least offer me a callback!? DM for more details
@united  why UA969 has been having problems these few days? Late and now cancelled for today?
@united #delayflightunited Flight delayed due to lack off ramp agents to load bags. UA1524 to LAX Unacceptable.

Stuck on @united flight 6446 for 2 hours now on runway. No information from @united   Horrible customer service.

@JetBlue kicking a man while he's down. over three hour delay and then a broken tv.... http://t.co/IDHxcoMbnt

â€œ@Daflash713: @1_hottcommodity when u coming back?â€ / TODAY .....IF bullshit ass @AmericanAir stops the delays smh
@DeltaAssist last week I had an issue with my flight. This week you gave me sitting on the runway for 47 ... http://t.co/OTnZbRBmAX
"@MySOdotCom: @AmericanAir  new design was so cramped. standing would have been preferable.
@JessicaHayesTV @AlaskaAir it is sad. does one really need a doctors note to say it's ok to fly with cancer?
8pm flight now scheduled for 2:35am. No idea why they don't just cancel it at this point. @jetblue you suck
Hey @SouthwestAir what is your policy on delays? Looks like I am sitting in at least a 4hr delay.
Silver lining of my cancelled flight tmrw: I just racked up a ton of points by booking last minute thru @SouthwestAir #moderntravelprobs
@DeltaAssist G75UZ6. MKE to ATL is delayed. I'm afraid missing ATL to TUS. My Delta app is upside down and I can't see my status. Am I OK?!
@AmericanAir I was recently on a flight back on Aug 17th and it was the worst ever. Charged for something I never received. AC broke.
@JetBlue now I'm stuck in #jfk n none of your employees can help me locate me luggage! Im  very upset with how you guys deal with this
Boy oh boy I can't wait to get back to ice covered New England #sarcasmgram @JetBlue http://t.co/DZuCQlK1sC

@AmericanAir this is so frustrating. We are in 2014 @AmericanAir http://t.co/ZNhgKPjgSG
What a rip off...still had to pay for a checked bag on @united and I have that stupid credit card...my fault for not flying @SouthwestAir
@KegsAndEggs_ @AmericanAir they really lost it??

@americanair is trash. Paid $75 for "extra legroom" which is made up nonsense now over 2 hours delayed. Want refund for phantom surcharge
Last time I ever fly @AmericanAir... Never had worse service..
@AmericanAir I bought this upgrade to first class. Starting to wonder why. Stewards are rude. no extra service. and I paid a grip of $$$$
@americanair delayed three times now. hopefully Ill get to NYC before graduation... #checktheweather
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir kinda wish I was stuck on that plane with you. ðŸ’–
Missin nephews bday party @AmericanAir pilot decided 2 take hour lunch #notcool #americanairlines #flight3044 #imissSWA
@AmericanAir Keep trying to ignore my emails. I will continue to contact in every way possible. Ref no. 1-2794254615 #worstcustomerservice
@AmericanAir how is it logical to charge $437 to remove one connection from a flight.I am making it easier for you.God you guys are terrible
@AmericanAir you've lost the business of myself and all my clients. Your customer support is abhorrent. AA45 JFK to LAS. 3/13
@SouthwestAir how do you get a refund for your wifi? Its always so painfully slow
@AmericanAir and now I have to wait another 35 minutes. I have shit to do and this already fucking sucks.
Nightmare on @AmericanAir. Kiosks down. App won’t connect. 20 min at counter. They slam door in my face. 15 min before flight—and SO rude!
â€œ@sammywilk: I really need my luggage so I can perform at 4 @united cmon!!!! It's crucial.â€ ugh I want to goðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
@JetBlue no TV on current flight BOS&gt;FLL. Paid full ticket price and got much less than promised. What % refund do you think is fair?
@DeltaAssist While I waited 30 days to book travel for a response that DID NOT answer my question. the fares for my flights went up.
The worst flying experience I've ever had @JetBlue http://t.co/VnFoJMW0wY
Onto city number 5. Now this is a long trip. Flying @united. Next flight in 3 hrs. #waiting
@VirginAmerica hi could you follow so I can do regarding a query over my cancelled flight from boston tomorrow?
Hey @united. remember the flt that was canceled yesterday. it's delayed again. Some of my people will miss their connection! Horrible!
Hahaha! @JetBlue charged me to take an earlier flight and the flight is delayed. We'll that was a waste.
After putting my 2 yo in a seat by herself @AmericanAir tells us: you don't like it then cancel your (long planned) vacation. #worstairline
If @Delta matched my platinum status I'd switch from @AmericanAir today.  Lost bag. again.
@SouthwestAir I wish I would've known @AirTran didn't accept pet reservations. I'll be missing my pup this Christmas. 😕
nothing like being on hold for an hour because @USAirways and @AmericanAir both think you need to check in with the other airline
My boyfriend is not amused that I'm live-texting him my airport adventures. Why did I get here so early? Why is @AmericanAir delayed?
@united what gives on your CS? After holding for 20-25 min. finally got a rep who then put me on a 1-2 min hold 15 min ago. Still on hold.
@FoxNews this is ridiculous. @SouthwestAir is awful and could have handled this in so many better ways. Condolences to the family
Never Flying @JetBlue Ever! Whatever Happened To The Customer Is Always Right? Stop Mistreating Costumers #BoyCottJetBlue @MatthewLush
@DeltaAssist not impressed. 1st flt delayed 1hr bc no paperwork; connection delayed bc of broken windshield wiper #DeltaAirlines  #epicfail
@SouthwestAir has the WORST customer service of any airline I've ever flown.
You guys suck @united now @ImJakePaul @LoganPaul can't board cause of stupid sue! #dontflyunited ðŸ’†ðŸ˜’
@DeltaAssist Can we DM? Your online sys not allowing me to do anything + tells me to call. I've still on hold for anyone who can help...
@AmericanAir late out of DC as. Overbooked &amp; gate checking most  luggage. Btw. climbing ramp old school style to board! Southwest next trip!
@AlaskaAir what's going on at SFO? 7:15 flight to SEA delayed hour already
@BrandedGreg inertia and deregulation must be a trend since @united has been awful. #ShareholdersOverCustomers
@Delta @DeltaAssist since when is JFK to SAN not transcontinental? All these negative changes are ridiculous! #leaveDelta
@AmericanAir 11 weeks waiting for my baggage delay reimbursement. Are you having a joke? Your owe me $510 and taking your time to repay!!!
@AmericanAir had the worst flight back from my honeymoon.Waited in line for 3 hours with computer delays to check in almost missed my fight!
@united I will never buy a ticket from.you!!! Never!
Waiting patiently for @SouthwestAir to release their Thanksgiving flights so I can book one to see @keepcalmmKERIon #anythingbutpatient
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for over five and a half hours... Can I please get help rescheduling my 6:58am flight?
@5000mgmt I think your twitter was hacked. It just tweeted out a compliment instead of a complaint to @united.
@TSA or @SouthwestAir lost my bike bag w/toolkit. lock. etc that was in a checked bag. You will find/comp me for this #NotCool report filed
At what point does @americanair cancel a flight? 7:00 flight now delayed to 10:30!
@Delta switching as much of my 2015 flying as I can to @AmericanAir. AAdvantage &gt;&gt; new Sky Pesos FF program
Surprised &amp; disappointed that @SouthwestAir can't/won't figure out how to transfer checked luggage to my @JetBlue connecting flight. ðŸ˜¥
@AmericanAir my baggage its lost!!!!! It is the second time
@Travel_Codex Heck. @AmericanAir. I don't charge a fee for my top 3 elite tiers. and I'm a fee-mad Texan. What's your excuse?
And another delay  that's two for two today....  @AmericanAir
Also. why does @AmericanAir app suck!? @Delta app knows where it's at! Everything I want all in one place!
@united you lost my luggage again. what's the status? File reference SFO40913M #united #unitedairlines #lost #badservice
@swandad @united I've had the water not working from yul to houston. I'd much rather entertainment down!
@AlaskaAir Some of your employees apparently treated a group very badly. and now it is on the front page of Reddit. http://t.co/dPPWUf8MeC
Nobody likes @AmericanAir. We are just stuck with it because @SouthwestAir doesn't fly everywhere yet #SouthwestIsBae
@united delayed for both legs today &amp;&amp; they stuck me in terminal A in @ewr.  #Tuesdayproblems  @Jetblue..pls add IND to your destinations!
@GrantCrabtree @SouthwestAir yeah fuck Southwest
@kirsch71 @jaketapper @united Eloy now it is your turn to apologize for trying to cheat the system.
@united very frustrated with you guys. never flying United again
@chrisdelia @united I booked the earliest flight out of school back to Chicago for 5am and didn't leave until 3pm after 29 other planes left
@DeltaAssist is there weather at JFK? My flight has been delayed 6 hours and looking at alternatives
@SouthwestAir So if your flight is delayed. the app (and the site) doesn’t give you your boarding pass after the original departure time :(
@AmericanAir Bag delivered at appx 2am (7 hrs late). Driver had promised to call with notification but failed to do so. We remain unamused.
@united poor customer service
@LilianGarcia @AmericanAir We live in Buffalo and my husband was supposed to fly out to Philly yesterday and his flight was cancelled!
@united 3590. I ended up canceling it because it is unacceptable to have to wait until 10 pm to fly home.
@united have been on hold for over 75 MINUTES on very expensive intl call! can you please reset my mileageplus acct so I can book flight?!
We've been sitting on the tarmac for like an hour &amp; some of the bags have been taken off the plane.... @JetBlue Are we flying to Boston y/n?
@united take note. RT @TheSoothsayer_: Worst check in experience ever @UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue please explain your standby process and prioritization. Do employees and their friends come before ppl who have been waiting 2 days
@USAirways @AmericanAir do you ever answer your phone? It's really pathetic. #imsodone #badCustomerExperience http://t.co/FxJotaAuAk
Today has been the worst travel day ever on @united due to a 5 hr delay in which we were told "just 10-15 minutes" the entire time. LAME.
@Isab1988 @SouthwestAir Yep. 24 Hours and no response...
Donâ€™t like where things are headed when coâ€™s like @JetBlue deny service to cust who tweet dismay - esp for 4 hr delay http://t.co/iDh0GkwOyy
@united wth 30 min waiting for a gate.. Now waiting for carry ons...I could be home by now!!!
Customer service. Responsiveness. Accountability. Words and phrases @united has never heard of. #AmericasWorstAirline
A little disappointed. @SouthwestAir. #ohwell #betterlucknexttime
@DeltaAssist Hello. Any status on my missing work luggage from last weekend from Berlin? Seeking a DM to gather more information.
Never flying @AlaskaAir ðŸ™…ðŸ»
@united wins this week's worst airline award...and it's only Monday!
@DeltaAssist AF changed our seats to terrible middle row seats. Is this how they treat your platinum &amp;gold medallions?  Please fix.
Every call to @united is like wisdom tooth extraction with no anesthesia. So frustrating always. #AmericanCallCentersPlease
@JetBlue flight 794 AUS-JFK cancelled and my friend Nerea Garrido needs to catch a flight back to Spain tomorrow from JFK. Rebook her to NY!
@united made me miss a connection. let me cancel claiming I'd get a credit. now requiring a $200 change fee to use the credit #Unacceptable
@united never fails to disappoint! 3+ hour delay and no word on why we aren't boarding yet for 9:45 takeoff.
@AmericanAir Can you put a reservation on hold for me? The website's not doing it... probably because of an "Operated by US" flight.
@BhamAirport @FlyFrontier Booked last night through @AlaskaAir. shame though. That was a very popular flight it seemed.
Long friggin day of travel. Stuck in DEN for the night. @united hooked me up with a hotel though. Much… http://t.co/Hj6XwVtQbt

@SouthwestAir Inflight wifi is so slow that I can even watch the Man U vs Man City game

@DeltaAssist delta  I have to check carry on and put my computers on the floor under seat? Unacceptable! This never happens on jet blue!
@AmericanAir need to communicate to someone re HORRIBLE experience yet again! This is originally re: FLT 3702 From LAX to DAY on 29July14
@JustinNFJK you deserve to rant. @AmericanAir is shit

Dislike__ RT @ansteady: Oh @jetblue you__re breaking my heart at Logan. Hour+ on Tarmac. Love you but my hard-won vacation is ticking by...
@AmericanAir by waiting 10 more minutes. you could have avoiding displacing a lot of people at O'Hare going to CMH. #DISGRUNTLED
Delayed flight... Smh @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir what's the story with the long haul- having no  tvs? Showing kids movies ? And the plane being so small for 7 hours!

Sent letter to @AmericanAir over 2 weeks ago due to flight issues and still not had a response or acknowledgement  #poorcustomerservice
@altonbrown @united Time to switch to @VirginAmerica

@united my flight is Birmingham and you guys decide to stop the fucking suitcase belt..
Got on the plane. 5 min to takeoff and plane is now out of service. Not sure when we'll be flying out. @united
@united once again proves they are the worst airline going. Rude employees and an inability to gate check bags is ridiculous.
@JetBlue  They are a horrible airline!!!
@SouthwestAir Fight 2774 MCI-CHS today at 1:30 cancelled. Phone line says 20 hour wait! Can they get vouchers for diff. airline?
@united ...the fact that you pay a fee to operate out of LGA is bogus... I'm stuck waiting at the gate… http://t.co/mYl1PrOJxb
@SouthwestAir I've been waiting on hold for 2 hours to reschedule a cancelled flight. Can you help?
@Delta @DeltaAssist Ive been stuck in the runway since 9 and stuck in JFK since 3 because of all the delays. This is unacceptable
Bad day at work!   Plane makes emergency landing in Seattle after worker heard trapped in cargo hold;  - @AlaskaAir http://t.co/CyXAWkGVTC
Not happy @JetBlue! Keep legroom and free bags!
@AmericanAir you mistook me. Issue is not lost stroller. Issue is where the stroller ended up we needed it on disembarking at LHR
Really disappointed @beatsmusic for not including any Indo-Pak music on @SouthwestAir flights. Way to ignore the musical taste of millions!
After everyone boards the plane you go through each and every passenger and check their IDs after a 20 minute delay?!?!? @SouthwestAir
I will never fly @AmericanAir again and do my best that no one I know ever does either.
@united I'm stuck in Grand Rapids😔 and my rescheduled flight is late so I'm not sure if I'm able to catch my connecting flight.
Burned by @united &amp; new mileage calculation system (got jipped on thousands of miles). Another reason to switch more business to @Delta.
@DeltaAssist just got the email. Man you guys are killing me with the 24+ hr travel time going. Was really trying to avoid that.
Almost 2 hour delay at #phl in @AmericanAir flight 1333 to Chicago. For SEAT CUSHION REPAIR/!:&amp;.@;!:!'n   #really
two @AmericanAir planes "not working" totaling to a 5-hour delay and no guarantee that it won't increase. so much for trying a new route.
@united #united flight diverted 2 Memphis and canceled. Speech cancelled. No book signing in Austin. Hope 2 get home 2 my girls safely in NJ
Will never fly @AmericanAir @USAirways again. However. they could benefit by learning a thing or two about customer service from @Wegmans
@united is ridiculous. 3.5 hour delay due to “air traffic control issues.” If you want to improve customer sat. have backup planes.
@MyStyleVita @DeltaAssist @JetBlue Delta? Free? Never....
@DeltaAssist need help to get home to funeral. F2125 delayed at BWI for mechanical malfunction.  Need to reschedule to get to Atlanta
@united Not really. Plane was an ice box for quite a while. Why does United have such a poor track record of on-time take off?
@JetBlue worst experience ever with flight #810 SDQ to JFK. Won't be seeing me in a while. #jetblue #horrible #canceledflight #unbelievable
@united did you recently chamge your policy for premier?  If I book a flight for me +1 are they no longer extended premier benefits?
@peregrinekiwi @united is the worst. My record for lost stuff with them is just shy of 1:1.
#BUSI323 students: Great follow-up to the @JetBlue case - Airline tarmac delays drop to record low in 2014 http://t.co/jOtYaKJIYi
@united no seats available from booking. 2h before dep get auto assigned last row. no recline. narrower seat. Disappointed. as always...
@DeltaAssist 32 min and counting on hold to find out why I got moved from an aisle to a middle seat for my upcoming 5.5 hour flight. Not ok!
@DeltaAssist can you assist me on missing miles from my recent trip?
@united kicks a girl with autism off their plane because the pilot was uncomfortable. This airline really knows how to suck. #yousuck
Despite our instructions to send our lost luggage home @United has now delivered bag to hotel-45min before we return home! #anotherbagfee?
This is NOT how you handle "Fragile" luggage @southwestair #disappointed. jonrskratch's photo http://t.co/raiVdkmdiD
@AmericanAir lost mine and my mother luggage today ðŸ˜” I really how it shows up!
@AmericanAir flight out of Houston delayed then missed flight to Manhattan because another plane was in our gate. Couldn't make connection
@LanasTwittah @AmericanAir American &amp; Delta are the worst! Gotta use @JetBlue or @VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir had some crazy delays today 25 mins delay by aa fire alarm at SAN/DFW was a freak thing but still made the flight to SAT :)
@AmericanAir never flying with you again
@united Why are you selling cheap upgrades in front of 1K's waiting to clear waitlist for the upgrade they earned? #notfriendly
@JetBlue because you do not work with United and can't facilitate a bag pickup? This is beyond frustrating!!
Terrible experience trying to get web and phone Customer Service help for a bereavement fare #UnitedAirlines @united #terribleday
I booked a trip 3 mos ago I had to urgently cancel. time to @JetBlue resolution:3 days. @AmericanAir:3 mos and still not resolved. why??
I get irrationally upset when @usairways clubs don't have the yogurt pretzels that @americanair clubs have. #platinum #toomuchtravel
@united in Houston international airport. No food. Late night in transit flyers eat before u get here. I mean not even a snack vendor.
@SouthwestAir intentionally damaged both of my checked bags! Skateboard wheels intentionally removed. 2 bag agents said it looks intentional
@americanair Read while waiting due to mechanical on AA4207. Delta pilots throw pizza parties for diverted passengers http://t.co/QoxltrvNfz
@sozanabdillah @united #disgusting
More @United idiocy.   Missing door on overhead luggage rack (an empty one) means 90 minute delay.  Why?  #WTF
Vincent London CS JB Manager at UVF. provided the worst service I have ever received in my life! B/C of him I am stranded. @JetBlue
@AmericanAir $200-$600 to "reinstate" my miles?Absolutely absurd..thank you again for wasting my time and trying to penny pinch a customer
I expected a no-so-smooth flight. but I'm still hoping not to miss any connecting flights due to delays =( @AmericanAir @AlaskaAir #HomeSoon
@united worst customer service ever! I'm trying to be responsible and not fly into SFO and no one can help me with my flight changes.
VERY UNHAPPY @JetBlue for a horrible #wheelchair #accessibility #travel issue. which I have NOT heard back yet on. Customer service???
@Sia @LaurenSocha @United FUCKING SCUM
@DeltaAssist DL54 to ATL 2nite mechanical prob. missed cont to PHL- given voucher to horrific hotel. ended up Uber back to @Marriott. Help?
@AmericanAir yes in dec.that is the problem. I have requested a refund.Get confirmation that I will be receiving a refund the nothing. Twice
@JetBlue I am disappointed.Not only is our flight delayed but I am not allowed to move to an open seat. #someoneneedstoputtheirshoeson
@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me lately!
@united our flight is delayed into DEN and we need to get to bozeman. Can you help rebook to a later flight?
@iamwill @united Actually. it's an hour.  You were late.
@DamonJOfficial @united Ouch! Careless f****! And #1 on top of it all. Should make any guitarist sick and furious as hell.
@AmericanAir I did. I want my money back ! I'm very. very dissatisfied !
I have tried my best to have patience with @Gogo but the speed is #TERRIBLE! I can't even download a 2MB PDF on my @AmericanAir Flt#1337!
@DRHereToThere @AmericanAir That's seriously whack. Ugh!
@united can u not delay our plane goddamn u already fucked us with your dumbass pilot coming into NOLA #NeverForget #NeverAgain
@Gogo I created an account with my @AmericanAir company code and never got my pin sent to me. Can you help? I'm flying in a few hours.
Disappointed in @AmericanAir. Alaska flight ticketed for wrong date causing mass layover. and no bag check in till 2 hrs before departure!
Unimpressed with @SouthwestAir. Tried to switch to an earlier flight with seats available at the gate in OAK and they said it would be $250.
.@united Airlines issues stern warning to pilots after cockpit mistakes put passenger planes in potential danger. http://t.co/EeSDewQ4y4â€
@SouthwestAir I've been waiting for a call back from customer service.  Show me some #luv please
#STILL WAITING FOR A MIRACLE 2 HAPPEN IN#EPL@UNITED
@SouthwestAir cancelled my flight then failed to notify me they rebooked me to an earlier flight. Almost missed my flight to New Orleans:(
@DeltaAssist flied to New York on Friday. supposed to fly back today at 7 but the plane had difficulties and we waited 1 1/2 hour
@sumaiyyahhh @_XavierD_ @united Not even surprised that UA pulled some shit like this.
Fuck you @SouthwestAir for canceling my flight after 7 hours of delays. Making me call my grandma to pick me up at 12 pm!!
@DeltaAssist a little disappointed with how delta handled flight 2181 tonight.
On any other airline I could fit my two bags and feet underneath but on @AmericanAir I can barely fit my tote! #sigh http://t.co/UVP8zL1dth
@AmericanAir Fuck you
@AmericanAir lost my bag INSIDE THE AIRPORT. you guys keep finding new ways to amaze me!
Worst experience with @JetBlue ever this morning. Used to think their customer service was great but not after today
I mean. I'm stuck in a middle seat. With a perfectly handsome man in first class sitting by himself. Come on @VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir cancelled flight at LAX to SAN no communication. rude staff. finally on shuttle bus. Staff should communicate. Compensation?
@united Pilot stuck his head out and looked around for her. saw nothing. went back to the plane. What is going on?
Our bags trapped in @AmericanAir is bad. but @united flight to Houston got deplaned and the pax were told to rent a car. And cops r here
You know for a cool airline you have some rude and unprofessional customer service reps over the phone @VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir on hold for 2:43 minutes trying to rebook my cxld flight....for real?!?
Once again my flight on @united is late. I rarely have an on time flight w them! #frustrated
@denbizjournal @9NEWS they're gonna ruin @SouthwestAir with that. @FlyFrontier is the worst airline I've ever traveled Terrible cust service
@AmericanAir your people in Miami are arresting @jeromejarre for no reason please solve the issue he's harmless!! #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT
@united please fix the Guam issue. Lots of weary travelers.
@united flight was awful. Your planes are terrible. Plan on moving everything over to @Delta soon enough.
@DeltaAssist disappointing that no response or offer to help 5 hr delay and offered one bottle of water and bag of crisps
Who has a private jet and wants to get me?@AmericanAir / @USAirways cancelled the flight last night @DeltaAssist can't get us off the ground
@united fucks up again. Delayed flight. Should have flown with @AlaskaAir
Never flying @VirginAmerica again. Book flight with points. have to move flight. forced to pay $100 fee. @JetBlue my new fav airline.
6 weeks 1 day and no response from @AmericanAir.  I guess they still have 20 days by their "We get around to it when we feel like it" ethic.
@AmericanAir Yes but I will now miss half of the conference I am trying to attend. Will not be flying with you again.
@muchjohnsuchwow @SouthwestAir are you fucking kidding me?
This plane smells like pee @United #ua893 #12hours ðŸ˜·ðŸ‘Ž
@AlaskaAir our flight 3497 got resized from 70 to 50. You’re handling this terribly. Let people on the plane and then kicked them off.
@SouthwestAir Flight attendant. standing by exit rows. waited until plane full and then informed us that we couldn't have a carseat there.
@united 3rd flight 3rd delay
@united - A new customer service low - turning paid members away from the club at LAX? #unhappycustomer
@airlinerphoto @violetpilot1 @AlaskaAir @LASairport @BoeingAirplanes @WaltDisneyWorld   I hate those planes.
@SouthwestAir - poor customer service at Atlanta airport. Don't act like you are doing your customers a favor...very disappointed.
“@DeltaAssist: @Brocantr0 Hi Nick! Have you spoke to our Baggage Service team to set up a delayed baggage claim?  *SB” they were angels ty❤️
@AmericanAir Yes. Both planes I flew on had maintenance issues yesterday.  And epic delays. NO concern for customer.
@united airlines is the worst airline ever. I swear. Avoid it like the plague.  Avoid it like the missing planes.
@united Where do you see this? When you sent this. a few hours later. and even now my flight shows as cancelled.
@VirginAmerica I just love paying $500 for a flight. being promised free tv and then not being able to plug in headphones cause it's broken
@united Patience - show me a Refund since you made the 10 hour flight miserable with audio/visual system not working. Time to look at DELTA
@AmericanAir hey guess what AA incompetence continues. left grb late now sitting on ord Tarmac. I guess they didn't know we were coming
@gabriella_aamg This is the exact reason I don't check anything. ESPECIALLY if I have to fly @SouthwestAir Sorry people are shitty ðŸ˜•
@united can't believe I can't even get water on this flight 307 that you have us all stuck on with 150+ passengers.
Thanks @JetBlue for having rude check in staff!!! Thanks @JetBlue for refunding me 163 in credits to an airline I don't want to fly.
@AmericanAir being put on hold for 40 minutes for current reservations is a joke.
.@USAirways fail: 2 hrs 20 mins &amp; counting on hold to cancel flight. Colleagues on @SouthwestAir: 2 clicks. Why isn't this online. USAir?!
@united It appear your Web support team's response to my findings was to increase your prices. Very uncool. shame on you!!!!
@united how did they manage to loose all 4 my bags. Half of the plane passengers also had no bags. Very poor. You are ruining my holiday!
@GamersNightOut @united yeah like breaking guitars . worst delays ever . the way they orchestrate and configure flights is beyond horrible.
@united your unorganised rude staff at Lax last night were Terrible !
@united we've been waiting over a half hour for our bags at BOS for flight 6438. It's ridiculous.
@AmericanAir i think i am talking to a robot. canned responses.  Still can't believe ther is no customer service PHONE NUMBER.
@DeltaAssist Been on hold for 45 minutes trying to reschedule/refund a late flight but I guess at least consistency?
very disappointed in the customer service. @united check in Sat 3/11at Bush Soon as I find out this lady's name I'm reporting her just mean
@P0TUS @KLM @Delta @DeltaAssist lmao!  Not that the bags lost. just at the kick ass way you're dealing w.it  #WhereIsIt
Love @JetBlue but...had a question and the front of the desk was blocked....not rude but not pleasant response...hope her day gets better!
@SouthwestAir your literally the worst airline ever ðŸ˜¡ how does a 52 min flight turn into a 3 hour journey
@AmericanAir landed at DFW and I have been waiting to park at a gate for 30 minutes. Can we go park at 1 of the multiple open gates please?
â€œ@ColleenB123: I have the worst luck with airlines. @AmericanAir lost my luggage. Someone Help! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­â€
@regibaby67 @KLM  Second time in 2 weeks. @KLM doesn't suck quite as badly as @AmericanAir when losing your luggage. but it's close.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines just lost luggages of 45 passengers from #miami to #caracas @ElNacionalWeb  @MiamiHerald
@IIJERiiCHOII @DeltaAssist YOUR A PART OF THE ILLUMINATI HOLY SHIT!!!!!!
@AmericanAir hours wait http://t.co/CwrDobdyvd
Because @JetBlue and @CapeAir lost my luggage. my colleagues are being treated to this today: http://t.co/qaHSMhUNPk. #businesscasual
@DeltaAssist Hi I sent three mess using the online form regarding my account and recent flight but no response. First one was a month ago...
I figured with the broken down @united plane yesterday in CLE and significant delay they could've waived the fee switching tomorrow's flight
@AlaskaAir wasted 2 hours of my life because some bozo opened the plane door without permission and damaged the inflatable raft. Flight 718
@DeltaAssist I am having troubles rescheduling my ATL to JAX flight due to departure delay. Would like DL2342. Conf: GC728P
@AmericanAir but the text doesn't say delay! It just restates the flight info and often hard to tell if there's a delay!
Delayed in Tulsa because of "crew rest" issue.. Evidently @AmericanAir didnt realize until 945am that last night's crew got in too late
Hey @AlaskaAir thanks for letting us just sit on the Tarmac in an extremely hot plane! The pilots are here... no more excuses! #GetMeHome
@DeltaAssist I hope you fuckers get sued.
@AmericanAir We have and have gotten no response!
@DeltaAssist You requested that I DM you issues experienced on a recent JNB-ATL-PHL return flight.  I did so yesterday.  Please update me.
.@jetblue Diverting my red eye home is not cool #YoureBetterThanThat
@united yes...your staff made our vacation and the terrible weather even more stressful and take no pride in their work
Hey @ConsumerReports if you're looking for another angry customer ping me! @united is making me miss a family reunion &amp; won't get back to me
Southwest cancels customerâ€™s ticket after he took flight. Another reason why I NEVER fly @SouthwestAir http://t.co/Gj2O2hAsRG
Maybe the most disappointed I've ever been in myself: just remembered to checkin for tomorrow AM's flight &amp; got C boarding @SouthwestAir ðŸ˜©
@AmericanAir how do i file a report for my broken luggage?
@DeltaAssist flight #7368 from Escanaba to Detroit. Missing coffee pot. no flight?? Seems absurd.
Oh @jetblue youre breaking my heart at Logan. Hour+ on Tarmac. Love you but my hard-won vacation is ticking by...
You know there's a problem when you are waiting to disembark after landing for longer than the actual flight was @united
@Brooklyn_Chase @FlyFrontier worst airline ever!!!! @AmericanAir are twice as better!!!
At the St. Louis airport @flystl. our @united flight to Houston is delayed. We'll keep you updated! http://t.co/LOVuoiu0fT
@DeltaAssist icelandair flights all canceled going to miss my delta flight from lhr. Can't make international calls from hotel.. Email? Help
@AmericanAir I had to cancel a trip and need to find out how to rebook using the credit. Having a hard time reaching via phone. Help?
@AlaskaAir kicks Mom with cancer off plane - She didn't have doctor's note. http://t.co/gblezSIBHP @SFGate Pitiful. disgusting. #NoFlyZone
@JetBlue I will never use your airline again I don't see offers to fly the families if those police execute around my fare dollars are gone.
@VirginAmerica no longer my favorite airline... flight 0412
@AmericanAir not only did you make me miss two connectors in two weeks you just bumped my preferred seat...#FAIL
@united get ur pilot to our flight we've been waiting an hour on the Tarmac and he's not even here yet helurrr
@AlaskaAir is really sucking right now. So slow with everything. Probably gonna miss the next flight too. 👌
@DeltaAssist I have been trying to call since yesterday and the wait time the four times has been more that 40 minutes I need help
@VirginAmerica I know you can't always help it. but my last 4 or 5 flights with Virgin have been delayed. No Bueno. http://t.co/WUKl6afOqt
.@united really needs to work on notifications. @ boarding time I get notified of gate change. 10min later notified of flight delay.
.@DeltaAssist u are either giving me money back for this disaster or I'm canceling my flights and flying @JetBlue (who would never do this)
Been delayed for over an hour.. First time flying @DeltaAssist @Delta // gonna miss my connecting flight in ATL now.. #happybirthdaytome 😐
@VirginAmerica thank you. Our flight already delayed.... Hope to get to #SF today - hungry cat at home )))
Remind me to never fly @united again.... Worst. Airline. Ever.
Never ever flying with @united.
@manuel_c @AmericanAir I know. I have "stickers" probably 3 year old which I have never been able to use.
Hey @SouthwestAir you royally suck today.
@united sitting on the Tarmac for 2 hr 35 minutes on ua3741 in IAH. Hope we get off before 3 hours tonight
@united  waiting almost 3 days for luggage. no spare clothes on xmas eve and no staff answering phone or to be found in airport #lostbaggage
@united flight 1642 got delayed from DEN. Just now got on bird. Probably miss connecting flight to NOLA. Sleeping in motel somewhere. Sad.
@Ruppism_ @AmericanAir aww ricky. bad flied experience huh? hope you have a better one in the future.
@AmericanAir horrible airline. hang up the man's coat! Anything less than termination for that flying waitress is unacceptable.
Literally having the worst service w/ @AmericanAir. Spoke w/ 5 different agents all morning I am STILL not able to get re-ticketed. #annoyed
@SouthwestAir While delays can unavoidable there is nothing worse than having us board the plane and THEN delaying it.  So hot in here.
The flying experience on @VirginAmerica  is light years ahead of @Delta @united @AmericanAir I feel bad even comparing them
@DeltaAssist I had a cancelled flight because of no pilot. No hotel and no food with an 8.5 hours sleeping on airport floor!
@AmericanAir waiting for the moment from up in the air to occur and pilot to call me up and give me concierge key.... still waiting....
@jwt0501 @united @Delta i had same issue a cple of months ago. you'd think they'd take better care of platinum and premiere customers.
@united again?!?! Come onnnnnn.  You guys are killing me this week.  Killing me. http://t.co/hGs40v6pqH
@csswizardry @AmericanAir Airplanes like to be delayed!
@united my friend can't make her trip 30 days from now and you can't refund her. can't let her change name. what can you actually do? #fail
United Airlines. @united. charging you $5 extra to CHOOSE A SEAT. You never fail to impress me. #goldchains
Just had terrible customer service experience by @SouthwestAir leaving LAX. Somebody owe me 20 push ups and a chilled fruit baskets
.@SouthwestAir the customer service at Oakland is horrific. never cared. #soutwest #customerservice given run around all day....
Hey @JetBlue first airline to boot me out of a seat I requested months ago... So unhappy with you guys.
AMERICAN AIRLINES SUCKS~ DO NOT FLY~ THEIR CUSTOMER CARE IS HORRENDOUS. PLEASE REPOST~ @AmericanAir
My @AmericanAir flight attendant napped in Row 3 most the way from GRR to DFW. #Disturbing #FAA #SafetySecond http://t.co/ItkvHaNmw2
@VinSanity09 @VirginAmerica but if I could fuck an airline it would be US Airways.  God knows they've fucked me.
Hey @united no AC on plane due to mechanical issues? It's 102 in here. Figure it out! @Delta - what's going on? Miss you.  @JakeASchwartz
I tweeted yesterday about @AmericanAir not getting back to me after 2 weeks about my issue. I WAS WRONG. (1/3)
Seriously @flySFO and @AlaskaAir - we have been waiting for over 20 minutes just to pull into the gate because another plane was at ours?
And it wouldn't be a trip home without @United delaying a flight. 4 trips home in the last year - 4 delayed/canceled flights #whyisthisokay?
Dear @VirginAmerica great flight but wheel got broken off favorite luggage on today's flight. Had plans to carry on but there wasn't room.
How utterly ridiculous! To switch to an earlier connecting flight w/carry on luggage @Delta charges $50. Another reason I fly @AlaskaAir.
@JetBlue your stock may be soaring for me but you're better off having no tvs rather than broken ones...
Come on @united. we'd like to get off the plane now. I am missing the sunrise in Cancun sitting in the plane waiting for stairs! #thatsbad
Still no word from @united about my damaged guitar. Like. not a word. #worstserviceever #whatservice
@AmericanAir Multi-city flight. Took another flight in to get in earlier. All flights cancelled. No warning and can't reinstate. Not in TOS.
Would love an update on my two hour delay whenever you get a chance @JetBlue
@DeltaAssist Our row on DL2279 must have missed the cleaning...row buddies also have tons of crumbs and sticky food on seat and pkt
Sorry @united. a $75 voucher doesn't make up for the day I lost due to your cancelled flight.  Is that all you think our time is worth?
@Delta @DeltaAssist delta is the worst airline never using them again #WorstBehaviour2015 #NeverForget #terrible
.@SouthwestAir you use to be accommodating and courteous. What happened?! You lost your competitive advantage.
@enthused @united Sad to hear #custserv
@AmericanAir let me get this straight. outbreak of Ebola. people want to cancel flights. and you want to shaft them for a fee?
@SouthwestAir You guys have cancelled my flights 5 Times this year...and every other has been delayed. #ridiculous #neveragain
@AmericanAir per federal law you owe me a 200% refund for involuntarily bumping me.  No response from customer relations!!! I want a phone #
@united I am on Flight 89 from Newark to Beijing.  Wicked delay---on and off the plane...
.@jetblue you cannot cancel my flight and then make it almost 2 days later!!! It's 256 in the morning and I am not happy! Please fix this.
Everyone should know that @FlyFrontier is the worst airline I've ever flown with. Seriously never fly with them.  @SouthwestAir all the way
@AmericanAir SHAME I am 7 months pregnant and one of your employees BETH refused to let me board early with my carry on Flight 1053 Mia~LGA
@DeltaAssist hey. @TSA. my laptop was destroyed by your security and i use it for 100% of my work that is 100% of my income. Any help?
@jmspool @united You more than most should know the need for redundancies and short-term solutions. Fixing poor #UX doesn't happen overnight
C'mon @AmericanAir delay at JFK due to frozen pipes? You'd think preventative measures would be taken for winter; didn't suddenly get cold
@united pull your head out!!! The GRIZ are out trying to recruit for gods sake! Delayed again!!!
Is @AmericanAir the worst #airline. or is it @Delta? AA phone reps come off like government clerks. but their coffee is better than Delta's?
@JetBlue why did it take 3 delays before we were told that #flight83 from #JFK to #Orlando was broken? Get us a new plane asap!
Annoyed w/@united for mkng me gate chck my bag bc there was "no more overhead" room.there are MULTIPLE empty bins. I carried on for a reason
@SouthwestAir was already to check out and lost my flights! Can't get through :( please help! #freezinginbuffalo
@united I've been waiting at customer service for 2 hours. fix ur damn planes so I don't have to board n deplane. ur inconveniencing my life
@TurtleDub616 man. I hear so many complaints about @united lately. really BAD. You see the dog left out on the tarmac in the rain? #SMH
@CoCoVandey @united Someone had a bad day!
@AmericanAir 9 hours and no response? You are normally better than that.
Seems @AmericanAir felt so bad about canceling my flight they needed to apologize... by robocalling me at 6:30am on a Saturday. 2 days later
@AmericanAir I can say with confidence that I am never ever ever flying with you again... Ever.
@DeltaAssist get your act together. I've never been on a flight yet with on time take off ever!   said thing is I'm freakin Diamond status
It BLOWS my mind that people actually choose to fly with @SouthwestAir ... No seat choice and the worst customer service to top it off 😡
@SouthwestAir you delay all flights from SNA to OAK over an hour and now we're left on the taxiway cuz there's no gate for us! Cmonnnn
@SouthwestAir The wifi on flight 1697 MDW to JAX is really spotty.  Very annoying.
my flight is delayed AGAIN so I've only got 1 option. Trapped in an airport drinking 1000 beers before noon. I HAVE NO CHOICE @SouthwestAir!
@AmericanAir @USAirways you guys seriously fucking suck
I  am very disappointed with my service with @united airlines.....because of delays. I missed my connecting flight from San fran to chicago
@Plane_Talking @AmericanAir 87 days and still waiting for a live human to call me. Is this normal?
@delta  @deltaassist Been on hold for 90 minutes now.  Still waiting.    Unacceptable.  #deltasucks
@united still sitting at the gate in PDX for flight to SFO. Told 1 hour delay. No movies until door close????
I know that to you @delta it's just another bag. but for me. it has all my clothes in it. and it's ruining my holiday @deltaassist #findbag
@JoeyDiggsJr @AmericanAir wait.. What? REALLY? Omg
@jetblue you wasted my time and I was told it was processing.  I'd like it honored as precedent rules in my favor here.  Thank you.
@Seitz_Unseen @united where are you stuck at?
What do you know. @united another problem with one of your planes. Flt 1158. Four and a half hours last week and now this.
United Airlines: A first-class cock up http://t.co/D7ZJ4FerLL @united this is karma from poor treatment of customers.
I've traveled SO MUCH. domestic and int'l. and I've NEVER been more frustrated and in disbelief with an airline than I am with @united rn
@united @SouthwestAir 9th time delayed in 24 hours. United is the worst
I thought airport wi-fi was ridiculous until I saw how much @AmericanAir charges for in-flight wi-fi.
Is anyone as bad at anything as @AmericanAir / @USAirways are at being airlines?
@SouthwestAir really hoping the head honchos in Texas do a heck of a better customer service job when we call there tomorrow.
@AmericanAir 0-2. Continue to cancel flights when others still fly. Makes flying Delta a no brainier. #noservice
@united the food was terrible. I was food poisoned
Way to ruin my Thursday night @JetBlue. How could u not have ABC?! I'm going to miss scandal!
Never fly @AmericanAir. I was interrogated about my disability when flying with a clearly marked service dog. Violation of the #ADA
@AlaskaAir So flight 22 is really getting to Chicago today? Surprised we're not delayed or worse.
Worst delay ever @united. stuck on a stuffy plane with no updates #3449 #customerservice
Anything you can do to help @DeltaAssist RT @masonites: Delta Airlines has the absolute worst personnel in the industry - beware
@AmericanAir your baggage system at LAX annex for gate 44 is crazy bad. Slow. long lines and no lighting. Signed an Exec Plat #fail
@jbrownedianis @VirginAmerica @ShondalandTV epic fail!  Next time @JetBlue!
4.000 SkyMiles "as an exception" is a slap in the face for 2 cancelled flights. Don't fly with @Delta CC @DeltaAssist @TerribleDelta
Arg. @DeltaAssist flight home from ORD is cancelled. the ticketing line is literally a mile long. wait time on the phone is 2.5-3.5 hours
Back on @Qantas today to cross the Pacific. looking forward to it. Last time was @united. never again.
Just realizing that not only did baggage handlers at @VirginAmerica ruined my MacBook Pro. my iPad is now ruined too. I mean seriously.
Delayed more than 2.5 hrs on @AmericanAir Saturday. now more than 2.5 hrs on @united today! Mechanical issues. Sigh.
@united GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. FLIGHT THIS AM CANCELLED ALSO? MADE ME STAY NIGHT BC YOU CANCELLED LAST NIGHT. NOW ANOTHER CANCELLED?!!
I can't fucking believe there's no SkyMall. I need a new raincoat for my cat @united #RIPskymall http://t.co/MgEOVCEEWI
@united "hard" is far from how the staff has worked the last few days in Texas. I've never had such a poor customer service experience
@AmericanAir Horrid service at TUL today for explat w 1stclass fare; no first class line; no TSA precheck; was told to use kiosk by agent
@SouthwestAir  on the runway at LGA. 18 hours late after you cancelled my flight.. Still no gate for flight 816. http://t.co/RQEHACcgSO
It's kinda weird to be at an airport and more outraged at a service provider than at the TSA. Shameful show.  @AmericanAir. Shameful.
Stuck at Midway going to Newark. No flights til 6am?? Really @SouthwestAir ? And no hotel or meal.. Won't be flying u again #disappointed
@ChrisBurkich @AmericanAir haha I visited their account and they have so much hate today ðŸ˜‚
.@JetBlue @NikeSupport @Seamless @comcastcares please encourage @budget to seek customer service #redemption. I missed 1st day at new job.
Whoever set that fire in Chicago this morning is really messing with my weekend. #BostonBound #Eventually @SouthwestAir
I miss Jack. Only. instead of Jack. I miss @VirginAmerica. OK. that's my last "mad at the airline" tweet cuz those people are assholes.
@united United should close down it's futile rewards system. I hate their meaningless advertisement.greedy.discourteous.non compliant.HATE!
@AmericanAir Is there chance of this policy changing? It has never been an issue on other airlines - and more than once complimented for it.
@united shame on u for kicking a pregnant lady of a plane bc her toddler was fussy! Why don't u just ban families from flying!
@ChristianLeave @AmericanAir u heard the boy. u suck
patience is worn thru. @JetBlue this is ridiculous. after a 3 hour flight delay. we've now been waiting on the plane for an hour.
It's confirmed. @united fail. Again
@SouthwestAir by far the worst experience I had with this airline.
@DimpledGirl it's funny you say that. We just flew Virgin Atlantic &amp; were not pleased. Never had any problems with @VirginAmerica though
@Delta is the absolute worst airline in the nation. Check out @DeltaAssist for terrible customer service/horror stories.
@united 1st class EWR&gt;LAX. Paid for Internet. Bust first 2 hrs. Had to buy more. Working. 10 min to stream 1 song on iTunes. U suck #TSwift
@united we were told flight 1436 is delayed due to ppl arguing over seat selection. Will you be compensating those of us who have to wait?
@swershing @united "waahhhn why wont you take off if there's a safety issue with the plane wahh" Platinum with both D &amp; U. They're the same.
@JetBlue I'm not a happy camper right now.
@SouthwestAir . @united . @AmericanAir actually listen to your coach customers. flying is already stressful enough. don't make it worse.
The @united terminal of JFK is sadly one of the worst United check-in and security spots of all airports.
I thought part of what sets @virginamerica apart is its customer service. Very disappointed after my latest trip from DCA to SFO
@AlaskaAir Still have not heard back. Getting frustrated....
Officially think @united cust serv ppl are the biggest jerks.2 horrible phone incidents in 2 weeks.just another reason I'm a @JetBlue girl
@AmericanAir flight 2387 baggage claim 25 still waiting for luggage. Glad it had priority tags and flying first class. What's the point?
@noobde @united Wooww that sucks!!!
@JetBlue My flight was just cancelled and I can't get anyone on the phone. How do I book a new flight?
@united @MCO Been off flight 1631 for an hour with no sign of bags. This is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir cancelled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@DeltaAssist hi! Looking to cancel a trip that is indefinitely delayed (3918 LGA - CVG). App and phone# are down. Help?
@united your bandwidth is awful 10/22 BOS - IAH.  This is not a competitive offering.
Flight cancelled due to bad weather? Ok. Spending the night w/ my baby in the airport? Ok. Not being able to reach @SouthwestAir CS? Pissed.
On hold with @JetBlue for 40 minutes now. I will not get stuck in this house with my parents for any longer. Stupid snow storms.
@united 15 hour flight to China and no wifi or video. They just thanked me for my patience. I am not patient.
@DeltaAssist Convincing. Pardon my sarcasm but the apology would be better served w/ a resolve...of my situation. not the bad look.. @Delta
@Justin_Neuman @VirginAmerica The smell McD's french fries ARE pretty unmistakable.
@AmericanAir Hi. my 1hr flight has been delayed for more than 2 hours. Do u know when are we going to depart? AA3335
@AlaskaAir first my plane gets delayed 2 hours. then a drunk woman gets escorted off. now waiting on Tarmac. Been waiting 3.5hrs to leave.
@DeltaAssist yr customer service worst as platinum I know never respond email complaint 9/18 mailed yr manager now new case no 30 days more
I am so mad at @AmericanAir can't wait to get to my final destination and call you.
Frustrated people #onholdwith @DeltaAssist: @somethingabtjen. @kristofferdiaz and 10 others. More: http://t.co/9hEsXMLDBv #custserv
Fucking #Atl @Delta @DeltaAssist broke my laptop !
I had a few late flights this month on @SouthwestAir. They tracked my other flights and went above and beyond with compensation. #yeaswa
@AlaskaAir and yet there are no flights from Alaska.  You suck.
@DeltaAssist @JetBlue @united My recent @AmericanAir flight is delays due to "Hazardous Waste". Got room for two more? CLT -&gt; BOS
Lots of delayed @united flights in Charlotte.
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica that's just ridiculous.  With all the modern tech and the bag labels How hard is it to keep track of a bag??
@AmericanAir it is too bad when the customer has to explain the only person at the counter what the benefits of advantage members are. SMH!
@EddieGrogg @SouthwestAir sucks that you had to wait an extra hour to take a trip that used to take 5 yrs but now takes 8 hrs w no effort
@SouthwestAir 6 hr maintenance delay and can't send another plane DTW-MDW? Anything you can do to make this better?
@AlaskaAir thank you for making my low fare claim even better. After the Sea-phx flt from hell. Thought you had to earn exit row (mvp)?
Hey @DeltaAssist are your phone reps not working today? Have been on hold for over two hours...
@united has been in the news lately for BAD reason. No flying @united for me...#UnityWithIvy#IMREADY
@united Is the fire in Chicago going to affect my flight plan today? I leave Cincinnati at 7:50pm and transfer in Chicago.
@united baggage claim at SFO - like a swift kick in the nuts. Minus the swift part
@DeltaAssist @Delta I made the orig. reservation in Oct.  If I had waited. the flights were $643 today.  Instead. I'm paying nearly $800!
@united waited 20 mins on runway. now 20 mins waiting for carry in bags.  And 0 bags have been unloaded from planes. Checked or carry ua6283
@AmericanAir let 4371 leave for Houston #mechanicmybutt
Finally getting out of #DIA heading to Dulles. Missed my connection hopefully better luck tomorrow on @united  #GoBroncos
.@USAirwaysCenter @AmericanAir Is it really that hard to give us update on Flight 601 delayed over 2 hrs!  @CXAlert
@PerezHilton @united screwed me over by overbooking flight &amp; bumped me and my 6 month old twice on a flight for xmas.NEVER AGAIN.THE WORST.
@united is a lousy &amp; irresponsible airline who harasses customers. Never chose this airline &amp; advice others not to do so. @nytimes
@Zak_Bagans @SouthwestAir I hear ya I do not like Air Transat seats are horrible
@AmericanAir Call @ 8:50am from AA: 10:40 am flight 2 Ithaca from Phil was delayed? I'm in Boston. told yesterday no flights today existed.
@panadero @united I'm just puzzled over what purpose the change serves. Letting parents wrangle the kids first prevents hassle &amp; delay later
@SouthwestAir what happened to taking care of your A-list Preferred! #customerservicefail
@SouthwestAir your customer relations department needs call waiting... Busy tone since Friday 2149320333
@united y'all canceled my flight last night @ 9 pm. put me on a flight to leave at 10 am. lost an entire vacation day and still haven't left
@TheTrevorKnight @AmericanAir never again :-/
A bad move by @united airlines http://t.co/EsJhcPEYSc
Been on hold with @AmericanAir for 7 hours… This is the worst. Never flying with them again. Can’t even check in. http://t.co/ttaJHSAKW9
Uhm. so there are riots in Baltimore. wedding cancelled b/c of it. but @united won't let me cancel my flight. Compassion for what?
Mmm...when @SouthwestAir says "$8 wifi". they mean "wifi that's so slow you can barely browse. let alone watch anything". Disappointed.
@tiarala @SouthwestAir fuck I'm so sorry. :(
Stuck on a plane in San Diego. @AlaskaAir boarded us before the flight crew. Zero air on right now. People sweating their asses off. #wtf
Hey @united my award booking has somehow been cancelled (not by me!). What do I do? Im in the middle of a trip!
Completely appalled at the negligent and horrible treatment my family and I received from @AmericanAir staff at @iflymia today.
@united Seriously?Seven time/gate changes now #no pilot after how many hours that you've known UA1087 llate? #pathetic
Should have known from previous experience to never. ever fly @United #WORST
Delayed flights are my *favorite*! How did you know. @united?
@united canceled my flight out of JFK. so I switched to LGA. Better not put me in a middle seat or near any babies.
Currently sitting on the tarmac in PHX bc @SouthwestAir can't locate the pilot..... #getittogether
#SpiritAwards @AmericanAir The worst PR you will ever get on live tv dont f...with passengers luggage
@TheShowThor @AmericanAir Suck it up pussy
@SouthwestAir waited for my Seattle flight bags for nearly 1hr at Carousel 1. Finally found them across the terminal http://t.co/ghtWGj3XZR
@joelmartinez @united You're telling me. Might I advise everyone to never fly through United nor purchase bogus "Cancellation Insurance"
@JetBlue I am terribly disappointed in the lack of resolution to my issue.  Empower your people to resolve issues. Major lack of cust svc
@americanair on U.S. air flight 4487. You have no crew. Flight delayed 2 hours so you can get one. May be too late to avoid storm. Awful.
@united no customer service available by phone this afternoon? Come on... #travel
SethRogen: @AmericanAir your problem solving abilities leave something to be desired. http://t.co/npqNzioRNJ
Missing my third @United flight today because of delays. Never happens on @SouthwestAir. Beginning to know how @mortreport feels.
@VirginAmerica - It'd be great if I could take advantage of your #CyberMonday FOMO40 special. but your booking site's latency is terrible.
@united "we could have driven there faster." - things heard while waiting for united flight 848. #wtf #flightattendantmixup #helpmegod
@SouthwestAir the staff doesn't pay attention and they let people board in any order then papers are on seats for reserve. That's horrible!
@united is it that hard to send my bag to barcelona to fix the problem one of your employees created by putting wrong tag on my bag?
there isn't anything I hate more than @AmericanAir
Way to go @AmericanAir. 3rd flight of 2015 and every single one was 3+ hours late @coopergreen #fail #newamericanshouldpullitogther #bad
@AmericanAir Hello the baggage of my friend its lost he is in New Orleans he is in a urology meeting !!! http://t.co/k7iLfzXLb4
@SuperVillainMe @VirginAmerica It's #badcustomerservice at its finest!
@SouthwestAir Way 2 FUCK UP my Mothers funeral! Do you have any regard 4people that use UR airline? I will never use U again. @JetBlue 4me!!
@SouthwestAir not until this morning because she was on hold for almost 2 hours last night past your latest flight
@SouthwestAir are folks allowed to buy priority seating and then save 5 exit row seats for their travel mates? Seems unfair.
@DeltaAssist How many people work the phone lines at night?? Been on hold for 1.5 hours!
@united staff at EWR need to learn baggage policy re: snowboards. Have flown with one for years. never with so much hassle as today.
@DeltaAssist rescheduled already. but getting there 12 hours late.
I want to go back to Nepal to see the kids at Kopila Valley Home &amp; School. I miss them!! @JetBlue #FLYINGITFORWARD http://t.co/ii47fE3jYN
Hmm. @SouthwestAir just posted gate 18A in LAX for a flight - where the heck is that? new gate numbering or remote?
@RAC lol you really think they give a crap about your status? telling you. the sooner you switch to a different FF prog the better @united
@DeltaAssist just took off LAX&gt;CAE via ATL very late. does it look like I'm going to make it or spend a night in ATL?
@AmericanAir just dealt with a rude representative on the phone when trying to upgrade for 1st class. Hung up on me and never got to upgrade
I can really tell @AmericanAir cares about my situation...not.Still no clue where my bag is. #americanairlines #angry http://t.co/ul9Xql9K8S
@AmericanAir I want person customer service.Could you please give me a number?Because my baggage was delayed more than two weeks.Thanks
@Delta @DeltaAssist I need some flight credit or something. you're own flight attendant was 40 minutes late to the plane.
I just flew in the hottest @AmericanAir Airlines flight ever. #sweatlodge #NotCool #
Just spoke with the RUDEST customer service rep after @VirginAmerica CANCELED my flight.  Thank you for your "great" customer service.
@DeltaAssist I'm trying to reach customer service and was just told that the wait time is two hours. (!!) What's going on?
why do I keep flying @united? of my last 4 flights: 1 was cancelled and 2 were delayed 2 hours or more. horrible. always.
@united Last 2 trips...flt cancelled no voucher...flt 289 just delayed 3hrs. #idontflyunitedbutwhenidotheysuck #lookingupCEOsemailrightnow
Every time I fly @SouthwestAir the flights are freaking delayed. Ahhhh I knew I should've stuck with @JetBlue damn this is nuts!!!!
@kristen @united outrageous. what planet are this company on? The guy deserves a reprimand at the very least @united a boycott #sigh
@VirginAmerica and we're still on the ground... Only one hour late after all. #toutvabien (SFO to SEA)
@SouthwestAir any chance for flight and meal vouchers for the 5 hour delay of 3217 from BOS to MKE?
@AmericanAir my mke flight 2 Chicago was delayed 3 hours. Now in Chicago sitting on plane w/20 min. gate delay. Can u pls hold flight to bna
@AmericanAir paid for an upgrade 4 LAX to Miami flight &amp; you changed planes. Ball dropped. Really?  U have a plane full of UNHAPPY people.
@AmericanAir + @USAirways My morning flight #826 just got cancelled to Charlotte but I need to make a connection to SJO. On hold #HELP
@united a plane without in seat power and no WiFi on the ord to sfo route?  #fwp I know but u can do better
@united first flight of the day and we're delayed due to "paperwork" Sucks when over 1/2 the flight has international connecting flights
@JetBlue Thanks. Uh. canceling a trip because my kid .... broke her leg on a JB flight on Monday. .... is irony the right word?
On @AmericanAir from LA to Austin. The plane is older than me! Is it bad when all the flight instruments don't work? Still on ground.
@AmericanAir seriously? It's like you're trolling. Do you even give a shit abt my business?
I guess all @USAirways tweets now need to go to @AmericanAir? Missed opportunity for upgrade is your fault as there were seats available.
will NEVER fly with @united again after today's experience at @FlyYOW
@united 6465. Half hour delay for sick flight attendant. Then we board and get trapped on Tarmac. What were pilots doing while we waited?
@SouthwestAir we are already back to Houston. Flights were delayed due to the bad weather on northeast.
@JetBlue. seems like they just wanted to drink my beverage.  Also. no #Mosaic pre-board.  #disappointed
My GRR air travel options. ranked: @Southwestair &gt; @Delta &gt; @Americanair &gt; walking barefoot to destination &gt; @United
@united I've have been on hold for 45 minutes. Estimated wait time was 18. Can you help? Need to update flight
Damn! RT @rehabprof: . @united So much for hoping I will leave soon. My flight has been delayed and I will be missing my connection. #1278
@united Got a message it is going to depart at 5:18 PM :( This is what I meant as inaccurate information.  Frustrating wait continues...
Showing my support of skipplagged by not using @Orbitz and @united for traveling ! So you are mad that you don't suck enough money? #bullies
@united @theregoesbabs Pathetic. Disgusted with the attitude.
Who tells your your 825 flight is delayed at 824 for 90 minutes @SouthwestAir does. is that standard practice
@DeltaAssist tried to purchase upgrade to F twice on phone and web...mysterious errors both times. No longer purchasing upgrade
Disappointed with @united for not allowing pre-boarding for families with young children.
Extremely disappointed &amp; angry w @united airlines customer service. You are NOT going to get away with talking down to customers like that.
@united the most annoying man on earth is on my flight. what can you do to help me?
At PBI early enough to catch earlier flight to LGA and @DeltaAssist @Delta is charging me outrageous $$ to get on. WORST AIRLINE EVER
- @DeltaAssist Could use help getting to #SXSW. 1st flight fr Albany. NY to Detroit delayed. Re-routed on Atl flight now returned to gate.
First flight of the day &amp; we're delayed because of "mechanical issues". @SouthwestAir continues to impress me! #Sarcasm
Damn. @united cant even come through for @juliajayay tonight. Very disappointed. Would @AmericanAir or @Delta let this happen? #Sketchy
@AmericanAir Your wheelchair assistance at #LAX is the worst! And your gate agents are miserable. It's no wonder your airline is failing!!
@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@JetBlue your customer services is horrible. I will never fly your airline again. I am so disappointed no one wanted to help me.
Can't believe the shit that @nikkijeanphoto is going through at the hands of @AmericanAir. I know who I won't be flying with going to LAX.
@VirginAmerica - your seat change system sucks !!
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica That sucks. :-(
@united @theregoesbabs  No excuses!!! #fail
@DeltaNewsroom. @DeltaAssist: I'm going to do my darnedest never to use #KLM again. #Schipol #indifference #ar
Another @SouthwestAir delay. But hey. you get what you pay for.
@united concerned about flt our lt of Aspen tomorrow.  should we drive to Denver and just get on connection?  how do we do this not cancel
@united never heard back from you!!!
@united never fails to make my life a living hell whenever I fly
Flight lands early and no gates open. Been waiting 30 minutes for a gate. Over @JetBlue
@SouthwestAir I'm disappointed with the lack of USB ports on my plane😭
@TIME @USAirways @AmericanAir I hung up after 30 minutes and the problem remained unresolved. Inexcusable!
@united Glad to know my claim I faxed in 3 weeks ago went missing. Nothing like having to wait another 3-10 weeks for damage reimbursement.
Why is booking a flight have to be a issue. @AlaskaAir
@SouthwestAir really #SWA?  I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR OVER AN HOUR TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.  SO MUCH FOR BEING AN  A-LIST TRAVELER WITH YOU.....
Just a heads up @AmericanAir - baggage claim A29 at DFW no longer exists even if the app says so. Just a wall. #secretcarousel
@AmericanAir The service at ORD gate K18 for  8:30 am flight 1192 to LAX was horrid. No need to take it out on passengers.
@FiveCrazies @united disappointed??  Really lady? Rules are one thing. Being rude and dispassionate are quite another.  You should know.
â€œ@AaronCarpenter: I hate you @unitedâ€ Why... What happened
@united you're the worst. but luckily the others are all crap too.
@cote @AmericanAir yup. i'm sorta sad. i'm a long time USair flyer. Liked it better than AA
i have had the WORST trip with @SouthwestAir in my entire life. worst trip. flight was delayed coming out here. so moved me to a dif flight
@DeltaAssist hey sorry I think I've had this problem with you guys before. but one of my connecting flights won't show a seat for me
@DeltaAssist Can you explain why I’ve received 9 time changes over the past 2 hours for this delayed #5405? Should have been home by now.
@united should be ashamed racially  sterotyping  a person who actually paid to use u. #unitedfortahera people power!
Hate @SouthwestAir. no corporate travel should have to deal with this herding of cattle.Good reason to fly @AmericanAir. they give me a seat
@united Flight 487 delayed 1 hour. change of aircraft. and still not on time. so premium seat moved to 27B and no wifi. #ridiculous
@DeltaAssist Trying to schedule alternate flight bc my connecting flight was delayed-have to wait 20 hours until next flight. Help me please
@SouthwestAir worst experience ever. my disabled wife was tested like garbage this morning. want to talk to someone! #garbageservice
@united are thieves!!! They will gladly sell you a gift certificate but do everything in their power to stop you from redeeming it.
What a waste of money. What ever happened to customer service? I guess its nonexistent at @AmericanAir
Wish @united #CRP gate agent listen to me. Told him atc ground hold would screw me. He wouldn't listen.  Now I'm stuck. Dude needs training
@AmericanAir lel i just got my dick sucked from one of yo hoe ass helper bitches on dat muhfuckin plane i cum window http://t.co/JBjIjwpEFp
1.5 hrs into delay on @united 438 @fly2ohare ....can't we just #getanotherplane??
Fuck @united http://t.co/J2cniV1hzI
my gf flies @delta ONCE to san diego and gets upgraded. i fly same leg 5 times on @AmericanAir and never get upgraded as plat. #timetoswitch
@JetBlue Don't understand how a flight attendant calling in sick results in redeye cancelled. Don't think @SouthwestAir lets that happen.
New #GuyCode starts in 15 minutes! I think? I'm stuck on a plane and time zones are confusing. @MTV2 @SouthwestAir
No more @JetBlue for me! Had the worst experience with them last night flying from RDU. Time to switch it up.
@DeltaAssist really unpleasant experience with check-in attendant today at JFK. Complaining about late bag drop after I waited for 20 mins.
@JetBlue I love flying with you but if you're going to charge $5.00 for a movie the sound should work. Issues with the plug in connector.
I'm so upset. @AmericanAir is making my life hell. I've never been treated so unfairly.
@united Wouldn't a proper pre-flight inspection prevent the need to deplane due to a safety or maintenance issue last minute?
Another win for @AlaskaAir: delayed 24 is no fun. but hotel + meal vouchers + $500 credit makes us feel they care.
@united I'm having problems with my flight nobody helps me. nobody knows what's happening
@AaronCarpenter @AmericanAir everyone hates them ðŸ˜‚.
@AmericanAir Today was the worst customer service experience of my life and you didn't even care. I expected more of you guys. #disappointed
How come the delta flight is delayed and I am the one that has to pay for the hotel tonight?@DeltaAssist DeltaAssist http://t.co/mmrt9KdYHO
Flight delayed because someone 'wasn't informed' he was doing the @united SEA-SFO flight...? ðŸ˜”
Stuck in the cell lot at @fly2ohare for an hour because @united decided to not get my roommates bags or something...air travel stinks!
Terrible holiday experience w/ @AmericanAir Took months to get response. No help. #TreatedPoorlyByAA
@DeltaAssist I sent an email to Delta. This entire experience today has been very bad. LAN to DTW and eventually to DCA.
How is it possible that @united messes up every flight I book with them? We're sitting on the Tarmac while they shuffle passengers around
"Why Airlines Want to Make You Suffer by @superwuster http://t.co/zi0YcBI31Q" "Calculated misery." "economy minus." fast lanes &amp; @JetBlue
@JetBlue #horriblecustomerservice #worstairlineever #neverflyjetblue missed my flight cause of lazy inconsiderate employees. Lost my bis!
@AmericanAir AA 46. I understand but it can get frustrating at times!
@DeltaAssist - flight DL9678 out of BCN to AMS is delayed - ur flightstatus says it's on time ?
@MelRuetsche @SouthwestAir - hey @SouthwestAir follow me so I can direct message you my confirmation # for the delayed LAX bags.
HEY @JetBlue ! i have been trying to book for 45 min cannot complete! BOO #bullshit #jetbluetheworst #breaktheice more like #breakyoursite
@DeltaAssist still waiting in the runway at JFK for over 30min after landing to get to a gate!
30 min waiting to check in @DeltaAssist am I the only one here? #GonnaBeALongDay http://t.co/WyBAsKSDT2
@JetBlue has terrible customer service. I will not be spending my money to fly with them. #BoycottJetBlue
@united  This case isn't first or worst case of what seems to be blatant #autism discrimination. Advocates see it almost daily.
@DeltaAssist lost baggage. Help?
@united where are your people for the Winnipeg airport?? they are late and there are people who need to catch a flight. Very poor ethic.
Another spectacularly shitty experience with @united. I'd say "flying with United" but they can't seem to get us IN THE AIR.
@DeltaAssist on hold 40 mins now and no response here either. Where can I get help?
@AmericanAir I have my luggage now. The issue is how it was handled. Customer relations dept figured a $50 travel voucher would suffice.
@jetblue please get your site together. i hope your new site won't be as frustrating to use as your current one. encountered so many issues!
Someone doesn't want me to get to Fresno... @AlaskaAir cancelled this morning's flight. too! Throwing in the towel and hitting the road.
Oh my god could the @JetBlue intro for the TVs be ANY LONGER.... It's like 15 minutes guys. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Tomorrow morning many @SouthwestAir flights have already cancelled. Contact @SouthwestAir for any changes to your itinerary.
@JonesHog @AlaskaAir you better have at least gotten some damn fries....._ but that sucks and I'm sorry. Get home safely!
How many times will this flight from DEN-JFK be delayed? Currently on #2 @JetBlue
@timoreilly @USAirways @united Now you know why we called US West US Worst
@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
@SouthwestAir Ba dum BAH.   Hey wait there's no drum emoji??
@Delta @DeltaAssist A missionary friend has to cancel a trip to Bangladesh due to safety concerns. and you reduce his refund by $1000? Why?
@RT_com typical American way of thinking! Although shame on @united
@SouthwestAir not only does your boarding procedure suck but you loose people's bags. I will never fly this airline again!!! #incompetent
@SouthwestAir LAS agents sent pax to MDW last night on delayed flight with little time to connect. Why. with fog in the area causing issues?
@AmericanAir @TeresaJLo what a useless and terrible customer service response. Don't you think I would track it if I could?
.@united If so. it would be quite strange that only 1 flight attendant was. &amp; I'm quoting a gate announcement. "missing." #UnitedAirlines
@DeltaAssist Hi. missing connection to DL1355. Looks like I have been reserved on DL2036 tix 0062372221198. Can I get seat 10D? If FC booked
Yeah @united Get UA 89 off he ground! This is ridiculous!!!!
@SouthwestAir will be getting the complaint letter of life if I miss this wedding due to their bad customer service
My flight got in 30mins early but they said I gotta wait 20mins to get my bag. @SouthwestAir y'all gotta do better than this. Smh
No wifi on this @SouthwestAir flight. Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot
@CLTAirport @AmericanAir fuck the queen
@AmericanAir has the WORST customer service/relations I've ever encountered. because it apparently doesn't exist.
@VirginAmerica Landed at LAX only to learn flight to BOS cancelled. No prob because Jonathan took great care of me - rebooked for Wed.
Seriously @United? Oregon mom says fear of her autistic daughter caused United to divert flight http://t.co/t39fpMuBwp
@united its been 9 days #UnitedAirlines delay in my baggsge search can cause me my #employment #bigloss
.@united you guys are a joke. do your job!Delayed over 2 hours because of paperwork!Thank god not everyone is as bad at their jobs as u r.
@BoeingAirplanes @AmericanAir miss my days in on job training
holy fuck. @SouthwestAir you're all gigantic pieces of shit.
Can never remember what I just read in a recipe or which airport gate is mine. @SouthwestAir didn't care enough not to give my seat away.
@kirsch71 @united Sounds like 3 out of 4 FA's were reasonable. Hopefully the FA who was not. was terminated. 1 person was the problem.
@JetBlue. I used to like you. Now you're unfriendly. your checkin agents are slow as hell and your planes are old and nasty.
@AmericanAir my flight shouldn't be delayed because you can't figure out how to fill out a maintenance report with @USAirways
@AmericanAir over an hour wait 4 priority bag delivery at lax really?
@AmericanAir sitting on the runway at DFW waiting to park. I have a connection in 15 to AUS. Can they hold for a few extra minutes!? Please
@JetBlue Thanks but not addressing the issue. I guess i will have to hope your website works properly on next promo
@AmericanAir filed 3 complaints for same problem and haven't heard anything.. Getting ridiculous
@AmericanAir it has now been over 10 days since I sent you an email about my ticket/flight error....still no response
@DeltaAssist My flight is delayed 45 mins because the flight attendant isn't here??? Maybe buy your staff alarm clocks! What a joke @Delta
@VirginAmerica have flow atlantic and was so impressed - not even on the flight for virgin american and frustrated and regretting the choice
@united Flight 1169 SFO &gt; LAX is late due to equip swap. NOT late arriving aircraft. Why so dishonest? #southwestair http://t.co/X8uB9G0yMd
@DeltaAssist no one greeting the flight and a shift change? and u knew it never made my flight?
@cathaypacific staff in MNL are terrible. They blamed @united for not confirming our flight &amp; made us miss it. Their fault. No apologies.
Aa screwed us w/out concern. Worse seat than paid for &amp; 40 hour layover.  U cost me &amp; @elmasrudy lots o time &amp; $! @AmericanAir @AmeriAirSux
@AlaskaAir your Travel Itinerary email has a broken image link. I think it is supposed to be your logo. Bad URL http://t.co/KnjBzd2Zu0
@SouthwestAir lost my carryon bag with my medication it.I could have a heart attack and they don't care
@AmericanAir can't get out of their own way. Literally. I better not miss my connecting flight. #DFW
Major issues booking hotel w/ @united MileagePlus.Hold 4 15 min transferred 2 wrong dept hold for 10. auto disconnect http://t.co/KGFOKQHcTw
@AmericanAir really a huge delay for no reason!? Flight1679 ORD to TPA! What is going on!
@AmericanAir AA1589 crew times out.  Now what? 45 min sitting on Tarmac already
For all asking about response from @AmericanAir re: my 430 am bag kerfuffle. no response in 30 days. Was told to be patient for another 30.
@Delta @DeltaAssist just flew from #Dubai to #Atlanta and the entertainment system was broken. Yeah. it's 16 hr flight. nbd. #NeverAgain
@SouthwestAir you guys kicked a guy off of a plane because he was wearing a shirt that said "fucking" on it. You guys are complete morons!
Seriously @united? Solution is to be stranded at the airport until Saturday? That's how you fix a problem that you caused? #flightdelays ðŸ˜ž
@AmericanAir I DM'd and got no response...
Yo @united no bags from 3854 DSM to ORD such a short flight?? Waiting now 50 minutes?? Ug
@SouthwestAir YOU BLOW AND ILL NEVER USE YOUR AIRLINE AGAIN
@SouthwestAir  why is flight 755 delayed? Bos to Bwi. And what is the status of the flight. Frustrating waiting with no info.
@AmericanAir is the worst company to use when flying. I will never use them again. and I'll make sure everyone in Boston knows about this
@AmericanAir do something about the wifi prices it's not like paying 31$ instead of 7$ would give better service. Same shit.
@donal_cahalane @united fuck me that's steep. Considering how lax they are with the carry ons. 2lbs extra in the hold us inconsequential.
@AmericanAir  lol. It's broken.
@ifenn can you get @SouthwestAir to hold flight 882 so I won't miss @inkblurt's workshop tomorrow? :P
Traffic was crazy at JFK tonight. I thought that I was going to miss my flight on @JetBlue. Luckily. I made it.
@united I had terrible flight attendants on my flight today. Very disappointed
bad weather forced cancel of DFW &gt; SAT flight today. so @AmericanAir automatically re-booked us for 2 days from now. umm. no. today will do.
Every plane I've been on over break has been delayed or had something wrong with it... Talk about inefficiency @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir you have flights listed on your website that are not avail. I booked over a month ago and was just told its a missed connection
Waited for 40 mins outside. 20 mins so far in here. #laxairport do NOT fly @SouthwestAir they do not have enough working employees here.
Thank you. @JetBlue for giving me JetBlueballs b/c you led me to believe I was finna "GET" my luggage upon arrival. but...you lost that shit
Imagine that. After @AmericanAir mechanical problems on Friday. I still only get an "I'm sorry". They don't care about their passengers.
Stuck on the tarmac for an hour! @united No Flight Plan!? What does that even mean? Babies crying. people getting restless!?
@DeltaAssist very mad about my lost luggage !! this is ridiculous never flying with you again
@chermc56 @AmericanAir ughâ€¦ I hate that! Hope you made it to your destination safely!
@AmericanAir I was curious how I lost my confirmed upgrade on 4638 just now?
@VirginAmerica no happy. a long drive to LAX to find flight cancelled. lost taxi and parking money. and Virgin couldn't care less attitude
@united You've made the last two days of my life hell. Broken planes and lack of service. Bush league! http://t.co/xK2yLFGGrY
@AmericanAir Please fix this. Christian is very upset!
@DeltaAssist I need help rebooking a cancelled flight. it's not found when I search by confirmation number or ticket number. Can you help?
Can't wait to not fly @united in the new year! After my next flight. I'll actively choose other airlines where possible.
Missing out on qualifying for @united platinum status by 30 miles :-( #Disappointed #MileagePlus
This is. so far. the time I have been waiting in the line for @lufthansa. Before that a call to @united took 3 mins. http://t.co/ukvRPWmyYS
These @SouthwestAir flight attendants are trying WAY too hard to be funny. and it's not working. At all.
@united still no response to my recent air travel issues. being 1K isn't what it used to be.  On a @Delta flight now. may become habit
â€œ@IAmJericho: Other people may like that joke. but me? Nacho much. @HEELZiggler @AmericanAir @AndyKindlerâ€ You guys ruined comedy for me
@haletothenoo @united United wtf stop harassing my friend you R literally the worst
Hey @united wonder how come on @AmericanAir @USAirways @SouthwestAir @Delta I can always get PreTSA but never on your airline? You different
Flights been delayed 2 hours. It's very nice watching the Mexican lady's giggle behind the counter while the rest of us sit here @AlaskaAir
Come on. @United . U've managed to lose my bag before i even leave the airport? Points 2 Darren @YYZ for his efforts. but get my stuff 2 me
Worst words to hear ahead of your @virginamerica flight : our entertainment system will be inoperable on this flight. Nooooo!
â€œ@AaronCarpenter: missed my flight because of @AmericanAir ðŸ˜’ they didn't have any available workers... HIRE MORE PEOPLEâ€  #usairwayssucks
@united is the worst ... I just want to be home http://t.co/Wd2YAuQzys
@united hope you get fined for the dog scenario.. Poor thing.
WORST flight service EVER @united
@DeltaAssist Is the LHR-SEA flight possibly going to be delayed even further?
Even with a four hour delay no better way to get to #SB49 than @AlaskaAir
@JarodNotJared @DeltaAssist I say esrn 10 more when flights are delayed or change gates last moment.
@SouthwestAir What idiot put this plan together? my connecting flight is a literal mile away from my international gate #ðŸ’” #never again
@DeltaAssist Need to cancel yesterday award ticket. Why can't we do via website like other tix? Wasting call center capacity!!
@united. consistently the worst airline in America
@AmericanAir an awful experience with you. A couple months ago you cancelled my flight all together and I had to take @SouthwestAir!
@JetBlue great job delaying my flight an hour and forty six minutes. You guys are the real MVP.
@DeltaAssist 19 hours later &amp; still no bag. Your staff can't even reach the courier service that is supposed to deliver the missing bag.
@SouthwestAir There are over 300 people waiting in line here in Phoenix and 5 people working to get everyone checked in. Very poor service.
@united stuck in SFO bc you overbooked flights. telling me it's due to weather. but sent txt saying due to air traffic. #compushotel&amp;flight
@problogger Were in not ridiculous to allow. I suspect a separately-seated 3yo would only need to vomit once for @AmericanAir to rectify.
Wow. Just heard about @JetBlue kicking a passenger off a flight because of a critical tweet. Absolutely ridiculous and abusive.
.@AmericanAir I understood when we landed in San Anton going 2 Dallas bc of bad weather (had to buy a new flight on southwest btw) but...
@SouthwestAir u suck
@DeltaAssist flight DL1213 has been cancelled and the iPhone app won't let me rebook that single flight. calling 800 delta # is a 2hr wait
Almost 48 hrs since I landed in Portland for Xmas vaca w/ the fam and @AlaskaAir still hasn't found my lost baggage. Not feeling optimistic.
@united File ref CMH35001M my luggage still not here. 40 minute wait on tf-number unacceptable. Can't do anything without bag. Where is it?
.@AmericanAir been sitting in plane at the gate an hour. Probably going to miss my connection &amp; be stuck in Dallas a few hrs.
My @united flight was delayed once again. and for the first time in a week I have WiFi. so here come the pictures
@united since when is it OK to snap at a customer and walk away not once but twice without a word? #rude #UnitedAirlines #notsurprised
waiting for boarding. (at @United Club in Chek Lap Kok) https://t.co/jiDMkghG1N http://t.co/ynIic9XiXV
@AmericanAir service is slow In STI :/ fix this
@USAirways @AmericanAir @BarackObama Fuck You! These two cunt airlines have merged to create a real worst case scenario.
I decided 2 fly @AmericanAir instead of im so sorry virgin.AAflight is delayed due to mech.Issues I hope you'll take me back @VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir so frustrated with customer service and Advantage Member Service!  This is so unbelievable!!
@JetBlue what do u have for BOS to SAN next few days? Was just canceled  on 0019. May try to switch airlines if nothing available
@DeltaAssist - sadly. another delay and going to miss my connection.  😞
@ellychavez @united @smquon #united is the WORST #customerservice #getittogether
😮RT @TheChainsmokers: . @united why don't you wine and dine us before you fuck us
@united JUST HAD THE WORSE FLIGHT FROM CHICAGO TO NEWARK
Bad: @SouthwestAir lost my bag last night. Good: You found it at 1am. Bad: Not delivered by 3:30pm. #WTF: No one knows where it is now.
Wow @JetBlue my aunt dies and I fly to TX to officiate her memorial and you won't refund a previously scheduled flight? Pretty pathetic.
@AmericanAir have boarding passes with seat #s and then call and they say me and my dad aren't on flight? Flight was canceled yesterday ugh
Whoops. I selected mail delivery for my @mulaney tix @ParamountAustin @MoontowerComedy  @SouthwestAir might need to delay my flight from PHX
Waiting for my VIP luggage drop. @united. FAQs says within 4 hrs if within 41 mi. which we are. It's over 5 hrs. Wish there was tracking.
@Fit_CrazyCatMan @AmericanAir Oh noooooo! The worse ever!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜¨
Odd story of the day: @JetBlue removes mom from flight in Philadelphia. Why? Because she tweeted about flight's delay http://t.co/bWVuoMnMuo
Never again will I fly @Delta @DeltaAssist! $200 fee to change a $178 ticket! Hope it was worth it! #deltasthenewcomcast #dolladollabillsyal
@united any idea why we are waiting for a gate at DFW international when there are quite literally 6 open united gates? Flying in from IAH
Update @AmericanAir and DFW....you are beyond awful! But even BIGger kudos to the crew of AA1031! #rockstars #deservebetter
@VirginAmerica Trying to contact someone re lost &amp; found on recent flight to ORD. Any help appreciated!
I really thought traveling couldn't get worse than delta but @united airlines is the worse
@DeltaAssist emailed tech service several days ago about an issue with not being able book tickets (error #100900R) no response bad service
Why am I waiting on a plane for a @united  crewmember who is late? Flight 3899 supposed to leave PIT at 9:54.Hope I make that connection...
@JetBlue Hi JetBlue. I need your help. I was booking a flight last night and the screen never loaded at the checkout page. I gave my info
@united https://t.co/xYr6Bw1LrT do you have a response to negative comments here?
.@JetBlue sells cheap tickets w/ltd services.That doesn't mean the crew can just come late and throw bags in the snow http://t.co/kH0zbvneXT
@AmericanAir more travel headaches. Ugh!
@united I have been without my bad for three weeks.21 days. almost a month. No resolution. no accommodation. Nothing has been done other
All @united flights are running late not just Chicago. #iWannaGo
@VanL As travel determines whether I can do my job. I have had to give up on @AmericanAir because of how often they cancel flights.
@AmericanAir any alternative options for rebooking flights? I've been waiting on the phone for over and hour and a half.
Flights cancelled for no reason. delays. and insanely rude people. @united @AmericanAir #NoExcuse #BadService #WishTheyCared
You're really screwing me @united airways. @SouthwestAir has never done me like that
@SouthwestAir who can I email about damaged luggage. I flew international ?
@united I demand 5.000 miles to compensate me for your poor planning. http://t.co/IWTMC6WALV
@SouthwestAir Flight delayed ok. I get it. but now on board and stuck here for who knows how long... Worst day ever!
@SouthwestAir has brought incompetence to new levels. How do you lose a bag on a 45 min flight and be unable to find it all day? #badservice
. @united Your airline lost my PRIORITY bag on a NONSTOP flight from MSP-IAN. I'm here for 1 day &amp; have an event tmrw. Pls fix your mistake.
@united You clearly don't strive too hard. since the 45 minutes spent prepping the plane. which could've been done ahead of time. screwed us
.@united the plane is delayed because the crew is still at the hotel? Seriously? How is that allowed to happen?
@united Is the worst airline to travel with! Standby and they sent out luggage to SF with no confirmation. Are you serious ???
@AmericanAir Charging $274 for cancelling a segment of your flight is absurd! You all should be ashamed for taking advantage of people!
@mistressmatisse @DeltaAssist is terrible.  This is why I sincerely hope that Delta fails to overtake @AlaskaAir as the top carrier here.
You're killing me @SouthwestAir! A 3-hour delay getting my son home from college today? Any chance his flight will get back on schedule?
@AmericanAir AA1655 has been stuck for 50min already: no gate available in DFW airport. You kidding? What about changing gate?
Worst of all their answr to my headache. 5 hour delay. rescheduling &amp; an attendant who cant speak English is a 9$dinner voucher @deltaassist
Way to keep it classy. @united.  Suing for "unfair competition"? Hilarious! Yet another reason I won't fly you. http://t.co/DMJIPv2xud
@SouthwestAir seriously? No window shade? Hope nothing else is broken on this plane. #maintenance
Wondering if I can get my money for the GoGo internet I just brought. ugh @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir I apologize. in retrospect I was in a heinous mood after a 5-hour delay due to the Midwest snowstorm and was frustrated when--
@miss_silvas don't give @AmericanAir an excuse! 45 min late departure is unacceptable
C'mon @united- the storm has flights delayed. but help me understand why your counter agents are unhelpful robots! #CustomerService #SaveMe
Hey @americanair - upgraded 737 on the LAX to BOS route better than the old 757. but the IFE kills quite a bit of under seat space. Bad.
Never flying @AmericanAir again. Over 3 hrs in delays (friends had Alaska flights same time 0 delay) and "bonus" delays when taxiing...
.@deltaassist To make @delta customer service experience complete: u overcharged bc of incompetence. then canceled plane. &amp; now LOST my bags
@united if story of "autism fear"is true. you've lost our custom and anyone I ever speak to.She was a customer too! #autism #autismawareness
Didn't know international meant no a list fly by priority lines at bwi. Quite disappointed @SouthwestAir
@marcusgrodd @AlaskaAir wow...that's your response??? Rude
.@AmericanAir today is day 60 since my email/issue with AA and still no contact from anyone. Had been promised to hear within 60 days. Awful
@DeltaAssist  Hi. merry Christmas. I need help my bags delayed and I need help please. I travel from AUS to CAI? Whom to contact pls.thnx
@Patriotsgirl31 Even that? BTW you &amp; @RedSoxaddicted look great. Sorry the game sucked. They also lost when I was at @JetBlue last year.
@SouthwestAir   Today. my daughters 7pm flight was delayed 4 times before being cancelled at 1am. Your customer service has vanished.
@SouthwestAir Flight delayed because they put the wrong fuel on it.  How is that possible???
.@SouthwestAir The wifi on flight 3588 from DEN to STL tonight sucked. but the flight was 10 min. early.
@AmericanAir How are you still in business? This doesn't happen with @JetBlue or @SouthwestAir or @united #flight #delay #lostacustomer
Really @united? Sitting on taxiway at DIA for 30 mins for weight and balance paperwork? We don't do this 1000x a day? Ridiculous.
Hey @united. thanks for nothing worst airline.  Figure how how to get a plane boarded.  @VirginAmerica has
@JetBlue I like how you rip off some of your loyal customers. ..way to go
@DeltaAssist Though the delay was #Delta 's fault. but I BOOKED it thru ATL to my gate only to be told that my cnxn had LEFT?!?! #DeltaFail
Another @united flight. another delay. Two hours coming. two hours going home.
I love deplaning on the ramp. And I love the smell of jet exhaust. @AlaskaAir did a great job tonight. http://t.co/YGUvUflpXJ
@AmericanAir  ... Please start taking care of your customers ... This is becoming a sad trend http://t.co/EOOwGMOTqe
It's awesome that @JetBlue will lessen #legroom 1.6 inches so they can increase their #profits by $400 million! Screw the customer. #America
@united Flight 49 BOM - EWR was cancelled on 4/10. I had to rebook on another airline. I want to be reimbursed!!! Fury.
Sitting by the gate waiting for my flight with @AmericanAir to SNA now delayed an hour. #FridayFlight https://t.co/khu6CYgXnK
@VirginAmerica I just wanna say the experience I had today at San Diego airport was horrible. The supervisor I believe whose
Great. have to wait 2.5 hours for the ticket counter to open... @AlaskaAir
This excuse is new to me. flight delayed now because a catering truck is late @AmericanAir #really? 1 hour and counting...
Anyone at LaGuardia airport? My 11am @Delta @DeltaAssist flight to Detroit has been delayed until 4:30pm. . .so I'm sitting here. . .
@DeltaAssist bag services  told me they had nothing to do with lost and found and said they could not do anything for me.  Help!
@AmericanAir how come ppl with less miles than me could get on the extra BDA flight and not me? I am beyond upset with you
@SouthwestAir I have been on hold for 25 min trying to make a flight change. can you assist?
Holy hell. @SouthwestAir! This has to be the worst thing I've ever heard! http://t.co/MoWEENx0fK FAA regulations prevent compassion?
Oh @AlaskaAir you've lost my first bag. and it's a big one. Bring me back that duffel and we'll be square.
@JetBlue Is your site having issues? I can't sign into my account.
LGA is the absolute worst. We landed over 1.5 hrs ago &amp; still not at gate. Poor @AmericanAir pilot sounds as miserable as we are.
@AmericanAir I'm aware. which is why I'm frustrated. How can the new American fix this for me?
@SouthwestAir just had a rude agent at the self bag area at DAL...this was new to me and others. patience/help would have been appreciated!
.@JetBlue terrible customer service. Talked down to/publicly shamed for being 12 min late for hr prior arrival. The attitude is not needed
2 for 2 on @united. bags lost on both of my last 2 @untied flights. hopefully this one takes less than the 20 days it took for the last one
@AmericanAir I have been holding on the phone for over 2hr 30mins waiting for someone to speak to. My am flight to Dallas was canceled.
Never going to book a flight with @united until a formal apology is given to @TaheraHAhmad ! We stand with you #UnitedForTahera
@united on a 9+ hour flight on the new "hightech"Dreamliner. Too bad the entertainment system doesn't work. Long flight just got even longer
This is shameful and deserves some real attention @united  https://t.co/NItDrtdeya
@united I've complained every time and never had anything fixed.
Kids have no idea we are heading to WDW tue for an extended vacation. Can't wait to see their face boarding @JetBlue #AKV #DisneySide
@AmericanAir Line of people at KOA waiting to check in for AA246 to LAX and THE COUNTER IS CLOSED. What gives?!
Somehow @united managed not to realize until AFTER FINAL BOARDING that there were no flight attendants on board the plane.
Why the fuck do I have to pay to get a bag checked in??? Fuck u @united
@united charged $400 in change fees and won't answer the phone. @SouthwestAir charged me $0 for the same thing. Never flying #United again.
Over an hour on hold with @AmericanAir at this point...come on guys.
did this million miler finally get upgraded on @united aft 2 yrs of fails?? Yes.only due to a 1k sponsor. Fail leg 2. agt error at booking
@SouthwestAir flight 271 to Hartford left at 1:50am instead of 10:05pm!!!' And now delayed to go back home to Dallas on flight 2332
@VirginAmerica I generally love your flights. but it's been 45 minutes stuck at JFK at the gate...kinda ruining my whole Monday.
Where's my luggage @AlaskaAir? Apparently it's at SEA lost &amp; found but still haven't heard from u!! #help #AlaskaAirlines #leftonboard
shocked 2 see a piece of 1st class cabin fall apart at take off. @AmericanAir compensate me 4 stress and shocked. http://t.co/dpxh7Sirlg

.@Delta I had the worst night of my life traveling with you yesterday. remind me to never travel with you again... @DeltaAssist
@AmericanAir three hours and forty minute wait though! seriously?
@jetbluescks @JetBlue looks like you have earned a professional troll for your good deed. I hope that you have reported the angry troll. Lol
Very disappointed. @DeltaAssist on my flight to LDH from SEA. No internet and no movies as your entertainment system didn't work. Ugh.
@AmericanAir worst experience as a Platinium Member 65PHF08 my luggage lost in Dallas AA222250 &amp; AA222251 with no answer ...for 4 days 😞
@united dealing with your customer care has been the worst service experience of my life. I am not young.
I was on hold with @united #UnitedAirlines and after waiting 90 minutes I gave up !  #CostumerService… http://t.co/vEHTbR6nzY
@SouthwestAir so how come no one planned in advance for the flyover today? Extremely miserable experience and still at #DCA.
There goes what little hope I had left: @United Airlines just put its top LAWYER in charge of customer service http://t.co/PHhlBq6QJz #fail
There's always some type of delay with @United ... So annoying man.
@AmericanAir flight 1437 departure time 9:20 Still waiting. Current reason is food!  Seriously? More imp't than connections?
@DeltaAssist need help getting home off of a mysterious "delay" STI-JFK-PDX

@JetBlue Hey- anyway to see why flight 1691 is delayed? Suppose to be heading to Costa Rica
I'm happy that @Delta decided to mis-ship my bag on the return flight. @VirginAmerica didn't have any problem with the simple task going...
. @SouthwestAir Hope you get this tweet from the sky. Your WiFi may have been the worst 8 dollars I have ever spent. Help me out!!!!!!
@AmericanAir Hi! Can you cancel a ticketed itinerary for me? Donâ€™t see an option online.

@SouthwestAir delay is keeping my Christmas wish in Sacramento instead of Texas tonight. Another lonely night. Miss you. Come home please
@united I called Monday the day when my flight was cancelled. Customer rep said it will be refunded. I still don't see the credit on my CC
@USAirways @AmericanAir I've been on hold on the exec platinum line for 46 minutes trying to reach an agent.  What is the hold up?
@AmericanAir one person handling boarding also causes problems

Shame on @JetBlue for caving in to a handful of Wall St analysts to jack up fees for tens of thousands of loyal customers.  Bah humbug!
What’s up w/so many airlines not having wifi lately? On 767 @AmericanAir plane &amp; no wifi fr Miami to Orlando?! Becoming as bad as hotels
“@VirginAmerica: @BrookTodd Sorry for the delay + thanks for your understanding.” You are welcome. You guys are the best.
@united PN496738 is my frequent flyer number. can you tell me why no response yet?
@SouthwestAir I am a huge fan &amp;loyal customer. but my last two flights hv been delayed for several hrs. SFO-&gt;AUS. Flight 2day delayed 4 hrs!
Every @united flight I've taken in the last 6 months has been delayed
@AmericanAir we paid for an admirals club membership through our Citibank AA card - internationally it never works! Frustrating!
@DeltaAssist I need contact information for a tremendous delta issue.
@AlaskaAir hey alaska. Your company is a piece of shit for kicking a cancer patient off a flight.  I will never fly with yall again

That moment the @AlaskaAir supervisor says you are 2 &amp; 3 on standby but the board says 8 &amp;9 #fail
Oh man. My @AmericanAir flight to DFW tomorrow was just cancelled. Hope I can get rescheduled to see TheKiddo play soccer.

@united worst airline ever!!!
First time flying @United in ages. Terrible experience. Poor customer service. Back to @AmericanAir and @VirginAtlantic next time ✈️
@united I could never purchase it. The flight attendant said it their server was down.
Dear @JetBlue can we leave early so I can get on the plane and sleep? Kthx. &lt;3
@DeltaAssist DL2103 is delayed. Now arrives CVG 7:51. DL3364 leaves at 7:58. How's it looking for a gate delay for that flight in CVG?
@AlaskaAir sent me a notice my flight was delayed to 1:35. It's 1:36 &amp; we're back at the gate. We're not leaving.
Never again @AmericanAir! #stuckinalabama #4timesnotacharm #howdareyouhanguponme
So what's up. @AmericanAir ? #AmericanAirlines damaged this paralympic triathlete's bike and hasn't responded to her http://t.co/FuTFedSHph

@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica way to go losing the mans undies .not good pissing off super awesome people.I expect buy him a year supply.
@SouthwestAir Flight 2296 delayed for hours. Can we get on an earlier flight?
@DeltaAssist I've been trying to add a lap child to my existing international reservation but the wait has been unbearable.
@united United. My gf and I have been trying to switch our flight to SDQ from EWR from tomorrow 2 today cuz the weather and it can't be done
@united makes me sick. Can't fly people with autism? U R ignorant &amp; completely out of line. Take ownership. quit the excuses. make changes.
@VirginAmerica VX759 SEA-&gt;SFO is CLEARLY delayed (I'm at the gate). can we get a realistic departure time? Gate agents are no help.
@DeltaAssist Engine problems caused us to get stuck during taxi. Safety first always but can we have air as we wait? A passenger is sick!
@DeltaAssist cannot Get anything to work on your site or app. Also your phones are are not working. Is this new level of customer service?
Another airline profiting from denying preboard for children and babies @USAirways @AmericanAir #fail
Basic customer service #fail @united - rep at #ORD quickly denied claim by @TheArtofBeer http://t.co/tihDbPv9W2 http://t.co/nuuUoo8vb9
Disappointed that @SouthwestAir has stopped carrying @vitaminwater . Anyone else feel the same? #SouthwestHeartneedsVitamins
@JetBlue please get my fiancé home.  His Denver-Boston flight was cancelled last night.   @tol1978
@DeltaAssist 2 weeks ago the problem was "data uplink" then weather. I feel like I'm being scammed. Didn't even cover the hotel cost.
@thomasaugusto @AmericanAir That's ridiculous. I've heard so many complaints from that airline lately. They need to get their shit together.
@AmericanAir No more priority lanes in terminal A at DFW? That was a disappointment this morning.
@DeltaAssist @Delta why aren't u keeping the customer up to date on your system issues. Delays along with system failure causes undo stress
@united is there any way u can get UA675 that has another Maint issue to push ten feet to gate so we can get off.
@AmericanAir can you please tell me what's going on with 1029? I've been on the Tarmac since 4:00PM EST this afternoon.
still waiting on a response from @AmericanAir to an email i sent several weeks ago. i'm so disappointed in this poor service. what happened?
.@united 38 hours after leaving Narita &amp; still not home. No hotel voucher. Found a 2pm @Delta flight to ATL. Fuck you. United Airlines.
a bit disappointed with @AmericanAir. Claiming our flight wasn't dlyd by mx. so denying any help to cover hotel $$ after being stuck at dfw.
@AmericanAir and ANOTHER issue with American. BOO
@DareLuck @united they cancelled my flight 3 times last minute. even when I'm at the airport because of "limited space"
.@united stole Xmas - literally.  Bags gone missing. including gifts.  A little empathy goes a long way. but no one seems to give a sh*t.
@SouthwestAir  I will never use your airline. Ever. http://t.co/43VjCkDu4X
@AlaskaAir You got to get your site under control. It has been broke way too long for a company like yours. http://t.co/RctF4Exdor
hey @SouthwestAir if you're going to have me on hold for 15 minutes at least play some better music 🐼😒😒🐼
@americanair any idea when you'll answer your phone again? need to apply credit to rsv on hold &amp; can't do it online. No callback option?
@MattWaldenAC @HoodieAllen @united AGAHAHAHA UNITED SUCKS YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW
@AmericanAir Sandy G on flt 5723 was extremely unpleasant! :( Sadly not my first experience w/AA-please work to improve customer service! :)
@DeltaAssist I've been on hold for an HOUR. Really confused.
@ggarvin Yes! @SouthwestAir is making @Gogo look like they run fiber optic cable directly to your seat. It's so slow. it's #Nostalgic.
@united I didn't get red - I spent 40 minutes not getting upgrade able flight to toronto - check the tapes - bad service
@DeltaAssist I'm mil on emer leave trying to get back to my family. Tried to get on direct flight to MSP but told it would cost $200.really

@AmericanAir looks like I am getting screwed over yet again. Why won't you honor the "rollover for lower rates" policy?
@VirginAmerica  is online check in broken?
@united has now switched my gate three times and delayed me 15 min because of so many delays. Who organizes this stuff. a 2nd grader?
@Adybeitler @AmericanAir Maybe the problem was that the pilot was handling the company Twitter account and got distracted....
#VEDay70 celebration in DC means mass flight delays and cancellations #nothelpful @DeltaAssist @AmericanAir #DC #fail
"@IIJERiiCHOII: Someone fucking called in to @virginamerica pretended to be me. and cancelled my flight. You're fucking joking right?" Rekt

@AmericanAir is ruining my life

Refuse to use @united airlines for my work travel anymore. A frequent flyer since 2012 and continuously receive terrible customer service.
@SouthwestAir We've been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I'm telling Herb.
Just saw new @SouthwestAir TV spot. I'm horrible for noticing this. but I saw the knee-high FA boots &amp; thought: throwback to the Herb K era?
@SouthwestAir been on hold for an hour. Do you guys ever pick up phone?
Irritated with @AmericanAir... ...who has time to be on hold. and then be treated rudely!
S/o @SouthwestAir for the legroom... Jk this sucks #improvementneedstohappen http://t.co/M940cVbPSr
I'm sister traveled w/ @united not only did she have to sleep overnight in the PBA airport. it has now been 2 days bag missing!!! Please fix

@TIME: JetBlue is cutting legroom from its planes http://t.co/cKz0IfFRxz no more free checked bag? This is fucked @JetBlue
Hoping I never have to fly with Kathleen again... Rudest flight attendant. @AmericanAir #dosomething flight 2465. Laxâœˆï¸ San Fran just now.
@DeltaAssist 0062368661974. Seat was broken.   12c.  Second time on this iternary   Unhappy
@AmericanAir poor poor treatment at LHR T3 checkin. Female agent questioned my OW Sapphire status! Will use other OW partners-appalled by AA
The internet was so unusable on my @SouthwestAir flight to St Louis that i couldn't complain on Twitter. $8 wasted.
@SouthwestAir I was in BWI storm mess last night &amp; SW staff stayed 7+hrs past shifts.Bags missing but PWM just called http://t.co/EA43875RGS
@AmericanAir your boiler plate customer relations responses are insulting to loyal fliers! #terriblecustomerservice

Wtf!? @JetBlue why is my flight delayed?! 1374 to New York #fail #thisblows
@AmericanAir can you guys tell me if my lost bag was placed on flight 1663 this evening?
@united it took about 8 hours after flight was cancelled but yes she finally got her bags

@americanair Your customer service sucks. Specifically. this gate attendant at ORD. gate H15.
@AmericanAir need an update on AA171. You should proactively put at-risk connections passengers on another flight. I can't miss AA283.
@DeltaAssist we know do plan to sit together. prefer not to be at back of plane like now. but not wanting to purchase either. Stuck!
@DeltaAssist Bird strike on a plane last night so wait until 20 minutes before boarding to call contract maintenance? #dumbassdelta
@DeltaAssist your workers are the rudest individuals I have ever come across and have no idea how to deflect any situation
@united #unitedfortahera #UnitedAirlines scum service people sorry to say but that's just pathetic. Learn some etiquette u low lives!
@JetBlue you have the worst customer service in the airline industry. and should really be ashamed of yourself as a brand #jetblue #travel
@DeltaAssist the cancellation I can understand.  It's the 24 hour rebook that is totally unacceptable.
Still upset @SouthwestAir for canceling my flight. and making me come home earlier than planned.

@SouthwestAir this is unacceptable delayed 2 hrs then you give us a broken plane so that we're delayed more remove ur heads from ur asses!
@SouthwestAir my goodness my flight was delayed almost 3hrs...people are grumpy &amp; tired. This will be a long flight.
Hey @DeltaAssist! What's up with DL4981?? 2 hour delay now.. Delta app says 58% on-time record. http://t.co/Cs2Lq9sSAA
MT @Faly88: Shame on you @united and @Orbitz for suing someone who just happened to outsmart U. How incredibly petty. #UnitedHatesAmericans
Nothing says merry Christmas like @united making an 88 year old wait an hour and a half for his bag
So @united asked for feedback on AMS to ORD flight. Filling out survey was bit like post-traumatic stress. Everything was dreadful.
@SouthwestAir my flight was 10 mins late leaving &amp; we cant pull into the gate cause another plane is their... I have a study session!! #HELP
@AlaskaAir I just went through a really bad costumer service experience &amp; because of it now I wont be able to spend the weekend w/ my honey

@DeltaAssist Off duty @SouthwestAir employee overheard my awful Delta experience and anonymously paid for my dinner http://t.co/XNbrQbBUZ9
@united Still no response to my emailed complaint on 22nd September.
"@TIME: JetBlue is cutting legroom from its planes http://t.co/CvSemoXwFJ" And no more free bags at base fare. Not cool @JetBlue. Not cool.
@DeltaAssist sitting in back AGAIN. Dmnd &amp; MM means 0. What's 4 brkfst? Peanuts and a side of "screw you" for your loyalty.Thanks 4 nothing.
@JenniferFopma @AmericanAir whaaat no tv?!?!!!  ðŸ˜²
Seriously annoyed with @united - if you make a mistake own up and fix it - don't give people the run around. My poor client!
@VirginAmerica Due to your flight from Vegas leaving over an hour late I missed my next flight. Now have to wait 6 hours for the next one!
Terrible. chaotic boarding process by @Lufthansa_USA MCO-FRA and FRA-MCO. Should take lessons from @united or @SouthwestAir.
@SouthwestAir Victoria. you failed to do what you told me that you were gonna do!!!
@jrspine @SouthwestAir doesn't sound like the service SWA preaches!!  Hope I don't have to deal with Anita at the Lville counter! #rude
@united my built in entertainment screen was down. All videos were lagging with no sound. Not a wifi issue.
@JetBlue Having serious issues with your site and hotline -- been trying to purchase tickets for nearly an hour and it keeps crashing.
@AmericanAir yes I did file a formal complaint. Still waiting on a final response.
@AmericanAir my flight to Indianapolis was delayed by 1.5 hours. Because of this. I missed my connecting shuttle to Bloomington.
@united I volunteered my seat b/c I was told I would have a hotel in Boston. but no one ever called to reserve it. HUGE inconvenience!
@DeltaAssist Baggage Service at LGA FAILS!
not cool. no different than other airline now RT @NBCNightlyNews @JetBlue to add baggage fees. reduce legroom http://t.co/vlxUMM5uct
@AmericanAir  again?    Original time was 12:30. changed planes.  and now new plane has issues too?!
@AmericanAir REALLY? U couldn't wait 4 7 of us. From a delayed flight. Minutes away That's all we needed! @wsdentallab was delayed cause ofU
@PipSqueakMouse @AlaskaAir This has been a growing issue. Passengers taking seats not assigned to them. and crew taking no action.
@AmericanAir I'm upset with you. Get me home.
@united I'm never going to make my connection if this "service" issue isn't done ASAP UA456 to UA5302
@AmericanAir You lost my hairdresser @itsryanrandall luggage w/ 5K worth of my hair in it.I beg u please find it 8-10 weeks is unreasonable!
@JetBlue THIS is actually terrible. You owe this customer http://t.co/Mm1HI4kkcF
.@United flight #1477 LA to SF leaving 45mins late. gate agents so grumpy. They'd better hold flight #520 to PHL so we make our connection!
@AmericanAir ridiculous that my flight aa3134 is delayed bc of paperwork!
Tried to check in for my flight this morning.  and the only seats available are ones i have to pay extra for @AmericanAir #fail #ripoff
@AmericanAir there is not enough room to explain situation here.  I've been ignored on Facebook. and was rude to when I called customer serv
#RT Terrorism will never prevail. #ISupportJetBlue #BlueLivesMatter #NYPD @JetBlue http://t.co/Kt909eo8Ld
Hi @DeltaAssist - My passport number is not updated on my upcoming intl flight ticket (India to US) - will it be a problem? Please advise.
@DeltaAssist the fact my issue hasn't been addressed shows that DELTA has no interest in the 300 employees I'm my company using them!
Disgraceful service by @Delta @DeltaAssist @travelocity @RoamingGnome  At BTV 2 hrs early. No one could fix an eticket date. Missed flight
@SouthwestAir flight 844 Phoenix to Denver. 10-15 people including me with missing bags. How does this happen? Stupidity? Laziness?
@JetBlue @ACKprincipal The rest of the day did not get better! There was no Wi-Fi in my section of plane...6 plus hours not working!
5 cancelled flights in 48 hours. @AmericanAir @USAirways  #disappointed
@united still waiting for an answer united...
@SouthwestAir hours late for flight to leave due to mechanical problems. This is the last time we give you our business.
@AmericanAir you are seriously the worst. Flown 5 times with you this past month. and today. Something goes wrong with my upgrade
.@americanair flight 2279 repair job of paper towels and tape. Is this the new American that is arriving? http://t.co/IDMGRT5Z78
Why is @AmericanAir soo useless? My flight 1542 meant to leave PHL to Dallas at 4:35pm is now delayed till 9:30pm. Every bloody time!
@SouthwestAir    #SouthwestAir  #badcustomerservice #norefund #lostfunds
@united some of the worst service I've ever experienced. Never flying them again.
Bring back Continental's pub flights.  It's a bust: United shuts down casino flights. @united  http://t.co/wJC4509zRy via @HOUBizjournal
@united your boarding process at @BostonLogan is extremely flawed...! People can't handle scanning their own boarding passes.
Why in the world did @united go down failed course of building own wifi vs using Gogo?  It can only be described as disastrous failure
@AmericanAir once again my flight is going to take off late #2for2#batting1000
.@SarahBlackwood1 I guess @united were never children. I wont be booking a United flight
@united very disappointed in compensation. Waited for 8 hours to hear cancelation after being triple delayed. Was stranded in Tokyo before
@DeltaAssist rebooking isn't the problem. 3 planes &amp; 4 hours late IS the problem. Any compensation?
I double dare you to find a more complicated/laborious WiFi sign up process then @united Can't believe I miss @Gogo
@davenathan @AmericanAir UGH!!!!!!!!!
.@united cancelled one of our flights today and now. after hours of sitting on a plane in Newark. they're possibly canceling this one?! Wtf!
When you take a 1/2 day because @AmericanAir says your lost bag will arrive at 2pm. but then it arrives 10 hours late at 12:30 am. #lasttime
@jonjonnyp @united you aren't already the worst?
@united another Monday another delay 3617 no safety briefing cards? Called in from previous inbound crew still not here. #incompetent
I guess a @SouthwestAir flight delay means an impromptu paper airplane contest http://t.co/WeRTxoU3N7
@United robbed my family of $700. 7 hours. and my sons emotional comfort. and the best they can do is $500 in travel vouchers.  Never again.
Just cancelled my @jetblue flight to NYC flight next week. What if the pilot judged &amp; pointed at me because I was gay?
@USAirways is the worst airline ever. Treated me terribly &amp; refused to do anything to fix it. Had to book a return flight to NYC w/@united.
Flight delayed due to rain but American Airlines flight at 6am to JFK takes off on time. We are stuck here.  Mint schmint. Really @JetBlue
@justlaurren @united you can claim for your delayed flight. Check to see if youâ€™re entitled to compensation- http://t.co/gspPqpHPP8
@AmericanAir not a single gate agent between gates B1 and B19 to help fix your delays that caused me to miss a flight.
Very disappointed with @Delta. Our seats were changed and now our group of 4 are separated. @DeltaAssist
@DeltaAssist Gso 1193 was delayed after deicing took a guy back to gate wasting 20 min causing untold # to miss connects in atl. Really?
@united Actually. you claimed to have sent it on US Airways and gave me very intricate flight details to exact its arrival. but it was a lie
@JetBlue @BostonLogan at gate C17 and the alarm has been blaring for 10-15 min. No attendants in sight and delayed. Please turn this off!
@JetBlue My 4.8 hours JetBlue flight turned to a 9 hours flight... And that if they don't change anything. So far. disappointed with service
@united still missing luggage (&amp;baby clothes!). Was promised it would be here by this morning from two different agents. help!!!
@AmericanAir is there any point to the priority tag on the bag??? Another fail.
Would v much like to marry two members of @united Airlines staff who made an unhealthily stressful journey slightly better today
â€œ@sampottorff: .@AmericanAir @GOLDENthe24k @EdwardZo very disappointed in such a big company. http://t.co/X4A3nPvr7Lâ€ðŸ˜³
@AlaskaAir done that as soon as I realized the bag was missing. Still nothing.
@AmericanAir at lax and again horrible rude service as a priority customer for years I was told I am not charged for bags and sent away!
@Kellilicious @AmericanAir I've been on hold over 2 hrs now 😢
This is a new excuse for a delayed flight on @AmericanAir . pilot fatigue. Late departure as usual and still looking for a new pilot.
@JetBlue terrible customer service
@DeltaAssist I'd like to cancel my flight now that it's delayed and I'll miss my connection. Why can't I do that online?
@AmericanAir lets try this again. 4 px connecting in PHL from STT to flight 1796. They will hustle over but may need you to wait a minute.
@AmericanAir you are the worst airline I've ever flown. I've been on the line forever and can't talk to a real person. No customer service
Hey @SouthwestAir Iâ€™ve been on hold for the last 48 min. Did you give your customer support staff the weekend off?
@united another 4 hour delay and I suspect cancellation of this undersold flight.  I've spent half of my weekend in delays on both ends.
Wifi &amp; TV is not working on flight 4018. Glad I charged my devices yesterday when I got this email. @SouthwestAir http://t.co/CDPBGN7ZIL
a lot of pissed off passengers trying to find their way onto our already full @JetBlue flight. likely gonna miss international connections
SWA flight 945 delayed after PASSENGER notices missing screws. #fail #SafetyChecksAnyone @SouthwestAir
@halseymusic @VirginAmerica im so sad that I don't get to see you live😭
@ShaneMosley_ @Delta @AmericanAir damn. do they not know who the hell you are and you have been on http://t.co/FVzVKw22lV geez
@JetBlue looks like my precheck didn't make it onto my ticket either. Would that be related? Never had a problem with it showing up before
@DeltaAssist horrible treatment from delta supervisor A. Bernstein. "If you don't like talking to me call again"
@AmericanAir flight hasn't even taken off yet and somehow you've already made a mess of things. Eat a bag of dicks
@united airlines deliberately lying. Telling delayed customers that connecting flights will be delayed. #UA210 http://t.co/gduoBUokCW
@DeltaAssist do you have a customer service line my experience the last 36 hours has been nothing but horrible.
I am thankful to @AlaskaAir for delaying my flight tonight and teaching me about #rage
I got @VirginAmerica inflight safety vid stuck in my head. Fun &amp; modern spin to the boring safety lecture. Great marketing. #VXSafetyDance
@AmericanAir the worst airline Ever!!! I can't believe they did this to my baby and I.
My friends say. "this is crappy customer service." @americanair Oh. geez. http://t.co/zrqAlaxgVK
Worse service ever on @DeltaAssist DL 16. Makes want to not fly Delta again
It must be easier to contact Air Force One. CIA and Mickey Mouse than customer relations@AmericanAir #nothappy
@SouthwestAir So I submitted feedback a week ago.  No response.
@SouthwestAir On hold for 22 minutes and counting...
@DeltaAssist trying to see about an upgrade for intl flight tomm.  DCA/Lima.  Been waiting 30 mins to talk to rep.  Can u help?
@AmericanAir April 10th - still no response.  How can I move forward with speaking to someone?
@SouthwestAir fucking me up with these delayed ass flight. ðŸ˜’
Why is ua 895 from hk to sgn delayed? Why can't United planes leave on time? @united your staff on the ground seem disorganized.
@united strikes again. Horrible cust service at IAD. Now flight delayed 2 hours. Never again.
Sounds like I will no longer be making a special effort to fly @JetBlue. Oh. well.
Why does @united continue to torment people on hold with vilest version of Rhapsody in Blue ever recorded? #gershwinshouldsue
Ridiculous! @SouthwestAir put my bags on the wrong flight and now I have to wait at the airport - and customer service wouldn't do anything!
Just had the absolute worst customer experience of all time with @AmericanAir... Worst airline ever. #massivefail
@AmericanAir canceling flight US4647 to Indianapolis for no explained reason!? C'mon. American.That's just terrible business #finalfour
@JetBlue I'm missing a bunch of True Blue points from my flights in August. Help?
@viajaVolaris is horrible Cannot print boarding pass. Website says 'error' or 'unavailable' all the time. Miss u @AmericanAir
@huck_AB @united that airport sucks the life outta anyone. My last stop there was a two DAY delay!
@Inghelbrecht @united that's brutal dude.
@AmericanAir came home after flying into DCA and noticed my suitcase has a broken wheel. Who do I call?
@AmericanAir delayed again frustration mounting DFW
Yea @AmericanAir 's customer service is the absolute Worst!!!!!!
Yo I never flew @SouthwestAir. It's like being in line for Cronuts except the Cronuts are your seats on the plane lmao.
@AmericanAir Spent 2.5 hours on hold last night. Will I ever get my luggage back? Gone since Friday.
.@JetBlue Sad to hear you've compromised your core values to please your investors.Always saw you as a standout against the status quo
@JenSelter @AmericanAir fly United next time boo they keep shit private
"United Airlines under fire for kicking teen with autism off a flight http://t.co/XIEQxs3FGa" via @dailydot #FlyAlaska @AlaskaAir #wings
@SouthwestAir Your PHX ticket agents deserve commendation. The line wrapped around outside but I only waited 40 minutes.
@AmericanAir I'm sitting in the plane for 2 hours waiting for our pilot to show up. #ridiculous
oh. haha. never mind. my flight was cancelled until tomorrow. good job @jetblue
It must suck to be a 'new crew' flight attendant in a plane full of upset passengers.6 hrs delayed @united SJU Flt 1260 #badplanes #grounded
@HeyyyyyJoe @SouthwestAir don't worry. in about 10 hours you'll get a "I'm sorry. has your problem been solved" tweet from them.
@tonyblood @AmericanAir clearly you haven't been drinking fast enough in the past!  Perhaps its time to switch to @united
Hey @AmericanAir your app sucks. Your app has AA 1741 on time but in reality it is 50 minutes late. @united kicks your ass in mobile apps.
@united O that is why it is screwed
@DavidUzumeri Because @united is the worst. Will never fly them despite Chicago being a hub.
@SouthwestAir You should reconsider calling your internet "high speed." This is unacceptable for paying a high price http://t.co/O4y1MxoM95
@AlaskaAir Trying to cancel a recently booked flight.  No prenotice of "cancellation fee". Should I tell my card not to honor the charge?
@AmericanAir letting people know u don't have room 4 luggage is a bit late at the gate. Notify sooner.
@DeltaAssist airport staff at #atl airport is terrible!
@DeltaAssist I don't understand why the bug hasn't been fixed yet with the calendar? This is pathetic. PATHETIC. FIX THE DAMN CALENDAR.
@AmericanAir I did... but I had to switch to your partner airline United.
@united flights on dec 30th: boi-den delayed. den-iad delayed iad-fay delayed ... Disappointed
Really. @AmericanAir?!  Charged 3 times for same ticket during YOUR system melt &amp; no #refund. no help 1 month later. #worst #customerservice
@united Excuses. delays. cancellations. lost baggage. bad bag handlers. bitchy. and hot. Think that about describes United Airlines.
@SouthwestAir I know there's bad weather. but I've been on hold for 30mins. Tried switching my flight. said change pending. now no record.
Both of my flights have been cancelled or changed without warning this weekend. @AmericanAir you have failed miserably.
@united I have been on hold for 53 minutes. Why do you treat your customers this way?
@united 0162433456207 and 0162433456206 are my ticket numbers I never received the fare vouchers on.
@united #UnitedAirlines -your service out of DAL is horrible. Gonna miss a family reunion/wedding because of your BS
Flight AA3331 delays after delays... @AmericanAir is this the new AA??? Remind me to fly United next time. UGH!!
@AmericanAir Proof of horrible treatment last night. @abc13houston http://t.co/n6IQk5RWEO
Hey @united. Tried you again. but sitting on hot plane for an hour at IAH hub waiting on pilots has me questioning brand loyalty. #lateagain
@AmericanAir thabks for the response. if I was offered to switch seats or miles to compensate it may have altered my perception.
@DeltaAssist JFK-&gt;MAD flight cancelled. Any chances to be into something different to JFK-&gt;LHR-&gt;MAD? I can arrive to airport earlier...
@united I will do so tonight. I was just waiting to get the invoice as proof :)
I still refuse to fly Southwest Airlines. Fuck those dickhead @SouthwestAir  Worst flights and terrible service
.@JetBlue kicked a woman off her flight to Boston for tweeting about delays: http://t.co/VtT62ejNaT http://t.co/BoKvidGJrX
@AmericanAir pilots from DFW to CHS are dishonest or clueless -their failure to share any information @ why we sit here 1hr late pitiful
Worst part - @AmericanAir could have picked better/faster travel options. Totally shafted me and two others I'm traveling with.
Never travel with @AmericanAir .Dangerous planes.Dallas to Madrid. needed to try three different planes. Getting to your destiny 1 day late
_@BostonGlobe: .@JetBlue to add bag fees on cheapest level of tickets http://t.co/ymEcb70RnX_ not cool Jet Blue
@united it's been almost a month. and I still haven't heard anything back from my delayed baggage claim. Any updates?
@AmericanAir We have to wait an hour and half for the next flight to arrive with our luggage!
@AmericanAir from a business flight got my luggage lost 48h and got it like this #Luggage http://t.co/y9wbJRMitm
@DeltaAssist no you suck
Hey @AmericanAir. I received the worst first class service ever on my flight tonight.
@AmericanAir #AA208 #NoCustomerService Our flight was delayed 1hr. is it too much to ask for water? Major attitude given by your attendants
Uh oh the captain said "sorry for the delay. waiting on some international luggage" it was all of @PTPGOfficial's gear. Sorry @united flight
@AmericanAir just check out the issues w fl#1372.... Again never fail to fully DISAPPOINT!!! #nothappytobeashareholder
Yay! @united screwed up my reservation this morning. So I'm flying home later than I thought... #sigh
@jetblue why is flight b6661 from bgi delayed? Airport staff not v helpful with info
PSA #2: NEVER FLY @AmericanAir. Horrible. Horrible.
@united and an hour late now
@SouthwestAir I know it happens - I was feeling so sorry for the Canton people and their delay. Just wish the agent had some details.
@kjolivier @andreleibovici You want to see SHIT service by @united? Charging 20 DOLLARS to get a receipt past 7 days http://t.co/2ePRJE9GIf
You're the best @SouthwestAir. Putting me up in a hotel even though my missed flight is weather related. @AmericanAir would never do that!
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir What an I incredibly iinappropriate response someone 4 hrs late to their destination.
Do you know if you cancel one leg of an @AmericanAir trip. you have to pay twice as much to fly one-way home? @AmericanAir is horrible.
Fully support @petedavidson. I've never flown @united but I assume since they're an airline they are indeed trash.
Extremely disappointed w/ @AmericanAir Not sure I want to do business with them again! $200 change fee is stupid! @SouthwestAir ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¾ Hello
How come I never flown @JetBlue - I think I'm missing out!
Been on hold with @AmericanAir for an hour #terribleservice
@AmericanAir. My wife stranded at LAX You cancelled her flight. No one at the gate to help. Over 100 people in line at "customer service"
One hour since boarding and still at the gate in Dallas. Flight should have been landing now #frustrated @AmericanAir
@united and it still goes on. my parents are stranded in IAH &amp;staff have been rude &amp;unhelpful. not even a hotel room. no one at desk.
@AlaskaAir great start to our vacation--not!. Load the plane then discover a broken jump seat. Sitting for 60 minutes-at least 40 more to go
@BoobBoo same #fail happens with @British_Airways and @AmericanAir :(
Further #fail @united flight 1653 delayed takeoff 30 min catering thing vectoring &amp; now  sitting waiting 4  gate @VirginAmerica here I come

@DeltaAssist Before we start. can you please give me your executive complaint procedure?
The @Starbucks in the @AmericanAir terminal at Logan Airport is constantly the worst store (corporate or franchise) I've ever been to.
Worst airline in the United States is United Airline. Don't fly it! EVER!! @United Flown them 6 times and 6 times they have screwed us over.
Writing my second complaint to @AmericanAir in a week. May not even use flight vouchers this experience has been so awful
@getoffmylawn80 @AmericanAir has horrible customer phone &amp; Internet service I was on hold for over an 1 1/2 hrs when I tried to book.
@JetBlue Been a loyal passenger since '03 and AmEx holder since '04. Today's news is not good news. You're just another airline now.
Hey @VirginAmerica wish I was flying with you back to SF rather than these Rude @united people. I miss you
@united can wait for luggage but not people for flights. Customer service fail.
@AlaskaAir extremely disappointed.  Do you ever leave on time anymore?
@SinaBahram hmm. so sad @DeltaAssist booking next time might be best with another carrier #failToHelp
@craigmabbitt @SouthwestAir I've never seen anyone so grateful for an airplane ride.
am delighted! @AmericanAir cancelled my 8 AM SEA&gt;JFK&gt;DCA flights tomorrow and booked me on a redeye thru DFW. SO BASICALLY. SAME! HI TEXAS
Seriously @SouthwestAir ?! We have been delayed for over an hour because of FROST on the wings?!?!?! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
This is why I never fly @united. Shameful! http://t.co/NNLQWfZ8jB #unitedfortahera
Why is it that every @united flight I take is delayed? @SouthwestAir you've got me next time
@AmericanAir It's been almost a week and no response..... 1-2747134060
Delayed for over an hour on UA1173 @united #becomingatrend #notcontinental
1st flight gets cancelled then the second flight gets delayed 2 hours. come on now aa :/ @AmericanAir
@AlaskaAir I will always be full supporter of Alaska airlines! Never fly anybody but them! They always are the best choice!!
Clients are stuck in@stlucia . @AmericanAir has cancelled the flights 2 days in a row.It's impossible to get reticketed.
@AlaskaAir you guys are killing me. I don't know the last time I've had an on time flight. When traveling for work weekly need reliability!
Hey @AlaskaAir FUCK YOU you for PHYSICALLY taking my board out of my hands and them being completely disrespectful to me after
@AmericanAir I was charged $1800 for a new flight after being told I couldn't leave the U.S. for 3 weeks - returned home on an EMPTY flight!
Have been experiencing a 5 hour PLUS delay from @SouthwestAir with the POOREST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever experienced. Stranded in ATL.
@DeltaAssist Online doesn't mean what you think it means. Also. I'm now on hold. Because I called. With a phone. Like it's 1965.
Delayed again. Does @SouthwestAir ever leave on time? #miserableflying
@united waiting for your answer.
Finally too 2months later after @AmericanAir and @iflymia told me it wasn't their problem for stealing 20k worth http://t.co/FNi6IzujLw
“@cf_sanders: 2 hours waiting on hold. and the @SouthwestAir phone line hung up on me. Ouch.”  Feel your pain!
@united The last 2 weeks I've flown wit u. you have given me 4 reasons to convince me it was a bad decision. Time 2 go back 2 @SouthwestAir
@Bibliogato @SouthwestAir That's... horrible. And that's putting it lightly.
@AmericanAir your service is nonsense here is your customer on Flight 2421 👎 http://t.co/hrhb2fcoKC
@AmericanAir waiting over 45 min for my bags in MIA @AmericanAir
@JLJeffLewis @AmericanAir no excuse for lost luggage # youhaveonejob
@AmericanAir has rerouted us to Chicago with no notice and then delayed the new flight over two hours with no update and snippy rude agents.
@AmericanAir DFW-OGG update these crappy planes! Spent $2K in upgrade fees for a seat falling apart &amp; mean flight attendants!
My @JetBlue flight out of Denver got delayed until 1:50 plus no one at the check-in counter. Starting to feel like @tomhanks in The Terminal
Hey @AmericanAir can we chat? I am trying to fix one leg of my honeymoon trip and I feel stuck! Help?
@SouthwestAir international flights via phone is worthless. Having to drive to RDU in a snow storm to change flight face to face
@landocriss whenever @united airlines is finished FUCKING ME
Big shout out to Annette over at @AmericanAir who got me on the next flight ASAP once my flight got cancelled #lifesaver
@delta @DeltaAssist Worst flight experience EVER. Ur 3 for 3 now.  You F'd up this whole trip.  Never had this problem with @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir stuck in Nassau. flight #1858 to BWI cancelled. Can't get through to customer service. Is there a replacement flight tomorrow?
@United I'm having a traumatizing time dealing w/ your customer service team re missing miles credits; You're about to lose another 1k flyer
@DeltaAssist having the worst delta exp ever. Will miss connection date agent would not help
@AmericanAir Customer Relations NEVER responded.  Not surprised. Haven't even gotten miles and segments from 8/1 flights. Unprofessional.
so disappointed in @united - i flew with them prob 12 times this past year. but it's clear the loyalty is one-sided. #movingon
@united needs to be investigated.  They took $25 from me for checked baggage feesand put me on a different carrier. #thieves
Second Delayed @AmericanAir flights two weeks in a row resulting in missing flights on my way home before work on Monday. Over you guys!
@NY_NJairports How can Jetblue be on time and have no delays. while @DeltaAssist flights have been delayed ALL day. Blaming on weather.
And so it begins...  #delayed @southwestair @ Chicago Midway International Airport http://t.co/J2GvVuqu9t
@Kyyyla @united I flew them recently and it was terrible!! Every flight delayed and I was on 12 in three weeks ðŸ˜‘
What the hell @SouthwestAir... Arriving flight was canceled; departing is delayed bc of mechanical problems for the foreseeable future
Back re-booking with @AmericanAir. Finals schedule change for one of the twins so this mom has to wait another day to see her son...#travel
Customer service fail @JetBlue at Boston Logan airport. How many agents does it take to assign passengers their seats 25 min before departur
You know when you are flying @SouthwestAir and you can just feel the captains say to each other. "Let's come in hot for kicks"? #wtf
Am i the only one having a problem booking on @JetBlue right now ?
Gee @AlaskaAir you sure did drop the ball on flight 2535. Aircraft arrived to BOI 9 min early and taking off almost an hour late!
ZOMG! After 134 minutes on hold. @AmericanAir just answered my call!  ... And now they're transferring me to another department... :/
@SouthwestAir  Widow says Southwest flight crew wouldn't let her call suicidal husband http://t.co/rLSLctefuJ FUCK YOU!
@AmericanAir I have never tweeted in my life. I'm 33. so that makes it relevant. I quite! How much money will it cost to speak to someone?
OK I have flown @AmericanAir twice in the past 3 months. BOTH TIMES I have missed my connection bc of a delayed first flight.
@DeltaAssist I need the next available flight to Des Moines once I miss connection in DTW. Still at the LGA gate that will happen
Year later. NO service. MT @bflogirlatheart: #T5Jfk is EMPTY. still subjected to slow/rude service in #newyorksportsgrill. not good @jetblue
@AmericanAir  this is a disaster you guys gota get your shit together. 3 terminals. Missed 2 connections. 3 broken planes. #Neveragain
Hey @AmericanAir who do I need to talk to about getting from Vegas to CVG today? You've already screwed it up 2x now I'm on standby.
@DeltaAssist I have been on hold. calling intl from Holland for 3 1/2 hrs trying to change my flight
Sigh. @southwestair cancels @twittastings flight tmrw to AUS to meet me. I can't get out till Sunday #noflights. Weekend #vacay #notsomuch
@DeltaAssist  .whats happening with dl5318 from FPO to ATL today? It's delayed. Do you know why?
@DeltaAssist I get it. you've got a mess. but you cancelled and rebooked for a different day. won't work. 2+ hours hold unacceptable.
@JetBlue as someone whose brother was killed by a terrorist on 9-11. it's insulting that you would think @MatthewLush is a physical threat.
@AmericanAir Frustrating to have luggage damaged. but even worse was the attitude of your staff- very unhelpful in situation. Disappointing.
Hey @SouthwestAir if I can't get the bag that was sent to St. Louis yesterday (I was not sent to St. Louis) I will be so sad
@SouthwestAir help! Lost iPhone 6+ filled out online lost form! called airport but no luck yet 😁 anything else I can do?🙏
@United travel companion certificate is a huge scam. Cheapest fare for it is 4x the price of lowest online fare. Time to switch airlines
@AlaskaAir were there problems w/ checkin system anytime since last nyt? My friend chkd in but missed flight cuz checkin didn't work.
Hey. @USAirways. you've been delaying my 1:35 flight more and more since 8 am. You'd think you could fix that in 5+ hours. @AmericanAir
@JetBlue can you please give me the status of flight #766 GCM✈️JFK it's delayed and keeps getting pushed later every 10 mins. Thanks
@SouthwestAir a little respect for the intelligence of your customers?!  Don't do the 30 minute delay update. We can handle the truth.
@SouthwestAir I don't understand early arrivals when we just sit on the tarmac waiting for a gate WN2275
my tv didnt work on my flight. Ridiculous. @JetBlue should give me a free drink voucher for sure and we wont have any problems ðŸ˜‰
@united told me to check my bag at the gate and put the wrong sticker on my bag and sent it to California now I have no bag #terrible
So @United takes 45 min to check me in due to "error in the system" and once again is late leaving the gate. Get it together guys.
@1171cinder @AmericanAir they're all muppets. they pretend to fix my problem and they muted me in a private chat.
What could be better than spending the night in the airport. you ask? A bag that never made it out of said airport! Stop it. @AmericanAir.
hey @AmericanAir. how long are call wait times? I'm trying to rebook USAirways flight out of DC. been waiting an hour. no end in sight...
Your RDU operations are really stepping in it this morning due to luggage issues from a flight that came in from Denver @SouthwestAir
@ebosshoops @SouthwestAir That's awful EB. Sorry man.
@united at it again.  Trying to get to Denver for my bro's 40th b-day.  Flight didn't go last night and missing plane for my flight today.
@AmericanAir One more time AA908 with problem before to take off. you must check the plain before aboard the passenger
@chrisdelia on a scale of 1 to ricky martin. how mad are you at @united ?
@AmericanAir still no sign of agent.  Are things getting that bad for you guys?  Is there anything I can do to help? http://t.co/K9ZLdAdjqh
@united terrible service with 6mth baby:cancelled flight.no hotel.luggage left in NYC still (with medicine).car seat taken-whatever next..!
@Delta @DeltaAssist 0 for 2 this trip with delta. Plane not at terminal so were clearing late yet crew keeps saying it's on time lol #failta
Thought I booked @VirginAmerica... I booked @AmericanAir ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and now my flights delayed 4 hours. Feel like this happens all the time w them!
@united 7th flight this month. All but 1 has been canceled or delayed. Really?! Why would I continue to fly? Zero compensation or goodwill.
@casieg @jetblue It still really sucks. It's sad that they are caving into investor pressure. Can't we just have a non-profit airline?
@AmericanAir NP. comes w winter. Wish gates/updates could have been better coordinated. Bumping departure every 10 min gets frustrating
Ugh. Now delayed leaving LGA. You can tell likelihood of delay by paint scheme on @americanair planes
@AmericanAir my flight has been cancelled. Who can I call to get home. This is ridiculous. This is the 3rd time this has happened this month
@united way to go this morning with your flight #1219 from Austin to Denver. Coming back from xmas vacay sucks but this is nuts!
A flight attendant on @United refused to serve my friend @TaheraHAhmad because she's Muslim.â€‹ #Shame #UnitedForTahera http://t.co/OOPHiHBZN3
@Delta @DeltaAssist so being delayed is now norm?! Fail!!!!!
@DJFrustration @AmericanAir switch your allegiance to @Delta @DeltaAssist They are head and shoulders above AA in customer service
.@SouthwestAir Very disappointed with how you handled by rebooking after you canceled my flight less than 12 hours before departure. #fail
@JetBlue late again. staff unprofessional and passengers not updated #JFK
@boopfm523 @SouthwestAir they just told us in Nashville that they are switching out the plane again! We're *supposed* to depart at 5:55
@blam @united it's always better to suffer on the ground than in the air
On hold with @SouthwestAir  for over 20 minutes trying to change itinerary.  Unacceptable.
Trying to remember why I fly @SouthwestAir when I have to pay over $400 to get an earlier flight home. Way to screw a loyal customer.
Third @united flight in two weeks. third delay due to  "mechanical problems." What is going on?
@united YOU SUCK!!! How dare you to allow this to happen on your shitty airlines. You can't get away with this!!! http://t.co/LukriVTjbn
@AlaskaAir I'm sad you don't have an #ipad #app b/c I got one for xmas. But happy that #iflyalaska for my first flight of 2015 tomorrow.
@united Never flying United again! #DeplorableService #Bad
@united so a first class tckt is lower than a business if I want to use the lounge? Pathetic for the price been paid shame ripoffs
@SouthwestAir Any idea when the RR cardholder drink tickets arrive in mail? I'm hoping to use mine to kick off vacay at end of the month!
@DeltaAssist I am waiting for your action you promised back in August. So far we have emails and promises but nothing else ref: 7674394001
@semil @united is it airlines in general. or are they particularly bad?
accdg to a @united rep that decided to call &amp; add insult to injury the employees @ the airport have complete discretion if they leave early
@AmericanAir  where is the service.  Missed planed no help
@united wife and I waited for hour &amp; 10 on the runway for 1762 to Chicago Cabin was so hot asked all passengers to open vents close shades
Sad to say goodbye to my @raybansungiass ... Found it broker after checkin my baggage in @united so #disappointed
@frantandillon @VirginAmerica everytime @JetBlue sucks dog dick.
Shame on you @united! Will never fly United until they rectify this with a clear policy and the pilot is disciplined. join  #BoycottUnited
been on the phone over 6 hours and 7 people to try and get money owned to me from @AmericanAir Customer service is terrible #worst airline
@SouthwestAir Customer Relations stinks. Did not answer the phone for 10 days and has now given a busy signal yesterday and today. Yikes
Anyone know if @united still issues #wx vouchers for 1Ks? I'm guessing no but #worthashot
@united my study abroad group's flight has been delayed for five hours. we boarded. and now we're being forced to exit to our gate again w/o
@ClaraJeffery @united @aloria United sucks. I miss Continental
@MrAdamAp damn.. This shit is never ending... send this guy a private jet already @AmericanAir . You guys obviously can't get Adam home
@jarpad @JensenAckles @AlaskaAir You two are a menace to bad customer service 😂😂😂😂
I wish @united charged less points for upgrades on crappy equipment. Just flushed 20k points to have a lady recline into my lap. #travel
@united your service is deplorable. ua5096 delayed due to broken lav. Now will miss connection in iad ua1445. What are my options?
.@United finally gets us rebooked to fly on Xmas eve--but mechanical problem causes delay and we deplane after sitting + sitting.
Calling complete bullshit on @united who increased a flight cost by $60 just to book a second ticket for my husband. Explain that. please.
An hour+ delay for flight first thing in the morning... @SouthwestAir
Hey @JetBlue just had the WORST flight of my life and WILDLY disrespectful customer service. Will probably NEVER fly with you again. Thanks.
My flight has been delayed because the plane "needs to clear customs" (what?). @AmericanAir is impertinent. I blame @andrewdarvin.
@TheCarlosPena @AmericanAir American Airlines always has problems. 😂
@united has never failed to screw up my flights ðŸš«âœˆï¸
About 20mins of promotional videos on @United flight before taking off... Also most ridiculous safety video ever #AreWeThereYet
@MattSerafini Never. ever fly @united. They're notoriously terrible with departure / arrival times.
@united flying to Chicago from Phl already late to board
@AmericanAir my buddys dream surfing vacation damaged by you. AND you charged him for his board but not bag of clubs. http://t.co/0LxRomJ2ZL
@united why is my known traveler number not working? I payed money to keep my shoes on.
@DeltaAssist  I lost an item on fly 675 yesterday. Can you help?
.@DeltaAssist Is it intentional that your app forgets my trips? Or is it bad design?
@DeltaAssist help me! Stuck in Pittsburgh and you've locked me out of my delta app!
"@asabfb: We may end up sleeping in the airport. but either way. @united fucked up. Again."
Without fail. each time I reach @united. the robo-secretary drops my call when transferring me to a human. #BringBackHumans #SecretaryRights
@united my flight ewr to Tpa 7;58 cancelled now I'm on forever holds. weather being blamed for bad customer service. put me on next flight!!
@united where do I go to provide feedback for a recent poor customer service experience?
I Valerie Cherish'd my disgusting and rude @AmericanAir flight attendant. "Sir. that seatbelt sign is not a mirage. it's on." "Is it?"
@Kbratke @Mr_RHolmes @Delta I'll say this. @united wouldn't let this shit fly. #HigherStandards
@united express? No. UA3337 IAD-PHL delayed 1h 11m due to late inbound crew. This sucks! http://t.co/OXGVJ38dGz
You should be ashamed of yourselves @united. That is all.
@AmericanAir made mistake having only 3 elite tiers and making exec plat 120 segments. Have to make switch to @united
@AlaskaAir I think it's really awful that I just paid $25 to check my bag but if I would've brought it to the gate you'd check it for free
Couldn't make one leg of @SouthwestAir flight. so they cancel the entire flight &amp; no refund?  A list for 3 years...never flying them again
@AmericanAir @USAirways Would u pls fix your systems so when I book an AA flt operated by US my status txfrs. Never added to upgrade list
@DeltaAssist been waiting for status match and trying to fly stand by. but being rudely told doesn't matter
@united gives me more problems than any other airline...thanks for realizing we didn't have a plane AFTER our scheduled departure time
First and last flight with @AmericanAir. Worst customer service. 😒 #TeamSouthwest
My @united flight delayed because of late inbound flight arrival. But this flight originates here. Very confused.
.@AmericanAir If you're not canceling the flight. please cancel the snow.
@United sold us economy plus seats and switched us out of them. Now the hassle of getting money back. #united #thanksunited
@AmericanAir So Flight 197 lands at 11:54 at Ohare. Boston flight 187 lands at 12:05a. No SFO bags yet. Boston is done. Horrible.
@dweinblatt @VirginAmerica @saminarind hell yeah!!
@AmericanAir has the worst customer experience.
My car smells like straight up @united bathroom 
@united disappointed in the decision to not honor a ticket that you had already booked and confirmed. I won't be flying #united anytime soon
@DeltaAssist called. they could not help. seems to be some technical issue. Hope i don't lose the seats.
@AmericanAir when is flight 1197 actually going to leave tulsa?  We've been given 6 different departure times already today...
@AmericanAir Flight attendant won't let me move to exit row on an empty flight even though I have gold status. This trip #stinks. :-/
@AmericanAir cancelled RedEye. No Explanation! NO! NO! @JLJeffLewis

To the American girls traveling @americanair on the Chicago Manchester flight who endured TWO mechanical failures I hope you made it ok
.@united pregnant employee flight cancelled SYD to Calif.You are delaying key trip to family and not providing equiv. Pls help
Airlines are missing out on huge opportunity I'd pay a lot more to fly on flights w/ no children I'm looking at you @AmericanAir @USAirways
Bag fees AND less legroom?!?! Come on @JetBlue !!! Booooo! I love flying you guys. You're ruining the few things that make you better!!
@dannysullivan @united @AmericanAir they respond.  Then you dm them. Then you never hear from them again. What a customer service fail
@DeltaAssist Our incoming flt was delayed on another airline and will miss our connection. Help to rebook please.

@united has rude flights attendants and desk staff. needless to say I'm done with this airline... Back to Delta and American
@EtihadAirways yes. I have. My flight was cancelled and no one has been able to get me a new flight. Including @AmericanAir
@AlaskaAir your WiFi is SLOW please update @Gogo WiFI to the new satellite version! @VirginAtlantic http://t.co/a5N1zUurzv #AlaskaAir75Kgold
@JetBlue your customer service at JFK is hampered by your policies or just liars. This is my last flight with you. #southwest here I come.
Rudest @SouthwestAir gate rep I've ever come across. Gate B11 Chicago Midway. If you hate your job. then quit.
Shitter's full @AmericanAir 1657. They are trying to locate another plane. after trying to fix the issue with the wrong part. Yay AA!
@AmericanAir @tmckernan this is truly just bad business.  Pathetic.
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@united how am I supposed to fly on Monday get delayed til Wed then go back in time to fly on Mon two days ago? http://t.co/Ig0aVNha2g
@AmericanAir you ruined my weekend
@AmericanAir and @flyLAXairport - everything about that checkin process sucked. Way to make traveling with two littles even worse.
Flying @united was so smooth and logical today!! @AmericanAir you may wanna take lessons... It sure wouldn't hurt! Ya can't get much worse.
Still waiting to hear back from @united   And maybe I'll be earning my wings and offering the best care in the air! :)
@SouthwestAir I had a delayed bag on a flight from Orlando to CMH Sun.  SWA at CMH said they would deliver now SWA says I have to pick up
Upset that @United is not crediting me flyer miles for my Thailand trip.I fly a lot.Wont be flying any company affiliated with them again
@united I've had two bad experiences with United where the delays just creep forward by 10 minutes each time
@AmericanAir I followed up with DOT &amp; FAA. If I don't hear from customer relations by Friday I'm contacting my attorney regarding my issue.
I hate flying @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir The wait to actually talk to a human is +1 hour. Will u reimburse me for my time trying to get my bag?
@JetBlue delayed 1:30 hours after a damaged control entertainment panel. thanks for the lack of quality!!
Hmm I want to make a change to @VirginAmerica flight that I used my rewards points and they want to charge me $100 #fail #elevatefail #scam
@donnatalarico @bamadesigner that's brutal! At least we're flying @SouthwestAir #heweb14
@Imasassyladyyy @united they broke a zipper off of my suitcase too!
@americanair Been on hold 90 minutes. I'm sure you guys are dealing with a lot of cancellations. but your system sucks.
Such a great experience so far on @AlaskaAir until I landed at LAX only to find my flight to OKC is 2 hours late #longdaytiredgirl
@united Cancelled my flight. wrecked my weekend. Kept my baggage fee. #Fail
@AmericanAir need help. 14yo son stuck in MIA urgent.
@SarahBlackwood1 It seems like these flight attendants @united never were toddlers. I wonder what their parents have to say.
My flight is delayed. Am I surprised? Nope. Why? Because I'm flying @united.  #makingthesamemistake
Totally sucks @matanaroberts how do you not give hotel vouchers @AmericanAir?
@JensenAckles @AlaskaAir @jarpad you are a despicable disgusting airline i hope you go bankrupt
@united You are in strict violation of DOT regulations. I can't wait until you get fined. http://t.co/QhWsstPPny     http://t.co/7VED5dCuiL
â€œ@taylorcaniff: Airports SUCK SO MUCHðŸ˜¡â€ are you taking @JetBlue like I told you
@ForbesTech @VirginAmerica  and VirginAtlantic were missed. Which makes me skeptical of the data.
@AmericanAir Your app says flt 1171 is delayed from PHX til 1:00. FIDS in Admirals Club says 11:30. Incredible confusion among staff also.
@united any idea why they waited so long to post the advisory?  Should have been done several hours ago. if not yesterday. Forecast was bad.
@united your $7 dinner voucher has been the most ridiculous move ever. And now +200 ppl are waiting for re-check-in #NEVERAGAIN #UNITEDFAIL
@VirginAmerica what's up? Can't get a flight out in time? trying to get to SF from San Diego. 3 hr delay? Should've flown @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist just some bad attitudes toward customers in my observations.
This happens far too often - Woman stays on hold with @AmericanAir for six hours (in March). Staff to demand.  http://t.co/93e8KdULhQ
@AmericanAir Still no luggage!!! Honeymoon without our stuff is SO sad. no swimming or anything! @Dreams_Tulum
Sad @AmericanAir @USAirways w/NOT respond to my complaint letter re: the offensive behavior toward me on flt 755 from France #custservice ?
@AmericanAir I understand delays. But it's extremely frustrating 2 be at a gate. with no plane. no announcement. staring at an "on time" msg
@united your terminal C baggage claim in Houston is slow and inefficient!
Used @VirginAmerica wi-fi to do 4 hours of work on the plane. allowing me to be a tourist in NYC vs being stuck in the hotel #OfficeInTheSky
@DeltaAssist what a disappointing experience to kona on an old B757 200 with broken seats. broken sound system  #proudtobediamond. Not
@JetBlue #Fail
@SouthwestAir your website will not let me book a flight &amp; I have now been on hold for 18+ minutes. UNACCEPTABLE!! Pls fix your site ASAP
No wifi on @United flight AGAIN. Cue @united tweet saying it's coming soon. Cue your tweets about me whining. Alright then. As you were.
@2Elevens @united we may be 2000 miles apart bro but we're together in UNITED hell! 7-hr delay and counting!!! #sum1callsmizek
S/O to @AmericanAir for mislabeling my flight with the wrong gate and making me miss my flight
@AmericanAir had to cxl a reservation this morning was on hold for 45 mins had to hang up.. Flight has passed
@united two economy plus upgrades are not enough to make up for my last 3 flights with you #terrible #annoyed
Missing precious time with my family all courtesy of @AmericanAir!
Damn! Flight delayed out of John Wayne airport. Gotta get to Vegas to watch Lawler vs Hendricks. C'mon @United !!!
@united I'm on a delayed flight from Rome and I'm likely to miss my connection in Newark. Is there anyway that you can help me re-book now?
Rude staff. dirty plane14octflight4248 hartford. Planedelayed busysky. broken gate. Missedconnection. Hadtopayforhotel.terrible!@americanair
@AmericanAir I have sent the complaint in to you as no one would take a call. I would like an appropriate response. ThanksZ
@AmericanAir get turned back to the gate for missing paperwork. now not enough fuel to get to Dallas. really? Cutting it close a little?
@AmericanAir still waiting at dfw gate b28.  Aa3002
Why does @AmericanAir have to suck so bad?????  I just want to get home!!!! 😢
@AmericanAir you lost another customer today. forever. w your wild incompetence + blaming me for your errors. @SouthwestAir forever
@united On hold for 13mins paying premium trying to book flights as your website is not working. Was told it would be a 3 min wait!
Dear @VirginAmerica 2 hour delay in LAX on a Friday. on Halloween!!Seriously not cool. Least you could do is offer free movies and a drink.
$100 for 15 lbs of weight. @jetblue #ripoff We consolidated bags to save space. Continue to be disappointed by your biz practices
@AmericanAir showing your complete incompetence again - over an hour late and you still can't find a gate.
@united I fly w/ you a lot. But today your constant delays is making me miss one of the most important meetings/opportunities of my career.
@daniellexo @SouthwestAir Are you kidding me? I have seen SO many problems with them. I am so sorry.
@AmericanAir flight 53 has been delayed 3 additional times between this morning's original delay and now. What's the problem?
@JetBlue Can you link me to where I can submit a request for a missing TrueBlue credit?
Ugh @united really?
Attendants on @USAirways plane &amp; passengers hanging in there despite delay :-) Sharing stories w/ my seat buddy. #travel @AmericanAir
Well. back to using @KAYAK to find flights instead of just going straight to @JetBlue its a sad day for loyal fliers
@AmericanAir could you please inform the status of my lost bag (AA839673); with the phone you gave me I only talk with a machine
.@AmericanAir @USAirways this situation is ridiculous. Neither one knows how to fix issues and yet you're supposed to be merging??
@AmericanAir  I was wondering why my bag wasn't on my flight an it was promised to be on my next one at 11 an they never showed
worst customer service ever...hung up on by united customer service after being transferred 4 times @united
explanation? because this is disgusting @AmericanAir https://t.co/2vUgkriEov
@United UA1252 deplaned twice already. Can we get PQM/PQS for each time. This is getting ridiculous
@jaysonstreet I wouldn't want to be trapped on a fight with a screaming kid. That said @united http://t.co/WrzJC1xLLJ
@AlaskaAir had to deplane bc of a mechanical prb :( on the bright side. we stormed the #LAX food court w our meal vouchers #StayPositive
@AllegiantTravel never had this happen on @Delta @united @AmericanAir plus having to pay $75 in luggage fees
2 planes. 2 mechanical problems. @AmericanAir. I’m worried to fly with you now #delays
@SouthwestAir in ATL headed to CAK for 5.5 hrs for a wiper blade motor with NO ETA &amp; NO AIRCRAFT chg. Unacceptable to this A-list member.
@JetBlue Good luck with your tech issues tonight!! All sorts of online flight status update problems #StillTheBest #AndBluest
@AmericanAir The Silence is so overwhelmingly loud! I'm nearly at the point of questioning whether I properly submitted my complaint form.
Just landed from flight 43 from Amarillo to Dallas and its was a very unpleasant flight @SouthwestAir The attendants couldn't even serve us
Already a cancelled flight... Come on @united get us home once! At least we found #SuperBowlXLIX to watch in Paris.
@united i have tried 2 times. said it expired. Very disappointed in your policies. Other airlines don't expire...i will fly them from now on
@AmericanAir i'm stuck on 4255. please get us out of here. i'm starving!!!
I really hate the @united award calendar search. I search for Business non-stop flights and it gives me economy flights with stops
@united #DEN flight 6214 to #yeg 3.5 hours late so far because united can not staff their crews. Poor management shown in Denver today.
Livid in Vegas. delayed. again&amp; again&amp;again. @SouthwestAir decided to cancel a flight and combine two. then waited on crew. now pilots.
@DeltaAssist I do not seem to be able to log into http://t.co/Ct994Tpg6v to book a flight with my Skymiles number. Is that not working?
@AmericanAir It's ridiculous that u charge $1400 2 change itinerary!  refuse 2 wave it due 2 bereavement!  Way too cruel! #howinconsiderate
@AmericanAir funny how my mom was delayed and stuck Saturday night and on her return flight tonight it seems to be the same old story..
@united Still waiting on that message from the baggage team.
@DeltaAssist why was I not informed of my flight cancellation? Isn't this against regulations?
Every time I give @united another chance to not be terrible they GET WORSE
@AmericanAir doesn't really matter at this point. since I'm going to miss my meetings anyway
do any @freelancersu journalists want to hear crazy shit @USAirways and @AmericanAir employees said to me on tape? It's truly unbelievable.
@united #No #response!!!
No better feeling than when the flight attendant gives you the WHOLE CAN instead of that bullshit cup. You stay classy @AmericanAir
@USAirways You got a mechanic from @AmericanAir to fix the situation and he failed. You don't even have your own mechanic? Thus is pathetic.
@JetBlue no TV for me :( http://t.co/rLDXHGBlS2
Almost missed my connection due to late departure out of Reagan. Phew! @united
Took this 10 mins ago &amp; I'm still on hold #SouthwestTravel....so @SouthwestAir.....customer service off today? Help. http://t.co/UVI1lcswTU
Usually fly @AmericanAir but flew @AlaskaAir twice recently. Went American again yesterday. Switching to Alaska if they'll have me.
@kennybarnwell @AmericanAir then replace the case The case had to be thrown around hard to receive that extent of damage. Unacceptable!
So @united  - you said DM you with details and wait a couple of days. I've done both. Care to DM me back?
@united every time I call your customer service number the call drops... After 30+ min. of being on hold.
@AmericanAir if you're going to charge a ridiculous amount for your wifi can you at least make sure it works? I can't even load a webpage.
Another #delta flight. Another delay. It's a poor trend! DL1716 @Delta @DeltaAssist
Hey @AmericanAir - LUGGAGE MISSING! Moving to new location tomorrow. stuff hasn't been found. Will you reimburse for purchases? #flightfail
@AmericanAir can't believe I am sitting on the tarmac just waiting to see if we can take off #DFW #SnowedIn
@DeltaAssist Flight 1894 with service to SFO has been delayed for over 3 hours.  Worried as I may miss a connection to a work conference :/
and i am now delayed 3 hours (I hate you. @united) so if anyone at RDU (that as usual. is not a murder) is trying to chill. hollatachgurl!
@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is cancelled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
@united how can you go in and change someone's seat assignment without their ok? No change of planes or equipment #frustratedflyer #nothappy
so @AmericanAir and @USAirways merged - you wouldn't think these people had anything to do with each other. terrible customer service
This is what a first class cabin with @AmericanAir looks like. Service sucks and food is gross.  All I got is a sorry http://t.co/o5elpsQNkZ
@DeltaAssist Have been on hold with reservations for an hour. Need to change flight in two hours. Pls help.
@united cancelled my flight and customer service failed to actually book the ticket on the next flight. Now on standby:( see my DM please!!
.@united flight 3585 was supposed 2 leave at 5:41 now it says 5:55. Its 6:00 can someone please tell us why we are delayed and when we leave
@united can you tell me which option I choose for compensation for broken in flight entertainment system
Oh @AmericanAir...the "paperwork" excuse again for the delay? I'm starting to think the dog didn't eat the homework...
@AmericanAir DCA waiting for a gate again. Tell the pilot to turn on the air. Passengers are not comfortable and tired of excessive wait.
I'd be flying @SouthwestAir like I always do. But traveling for work so it wasn't my choice. Ugh. #JuliaAtJAXDeltaIsTheWorst
Will NEVER do that route with United Airlines. Inc. Again!  #ATL - #IAD - #LHR @united #travel... http://t.co/Riw6uWOmIl
@AmericanAir I have some problems with my reservation and I leave on Friday. Is there someone I can contact?
Why is it that my @AmericanAir flights always have technical issues when I need them to be on time. May finally be time to try Delta.
@DeltaAssist are there problems with your phone lines today? Was on hold for nearly an hour earlier. had to go. and now holding for 20+.
On the 2nd day of Christmas @AmericanAir gave to me a cancelled flight and a change fee
@jetblue Goodbye JetBlue. Bag fees. seat pitch from 33 to 34?  Losing the reason why I fly you.  Shame.  Chasing stock price.
@lufthansa @united You suck even more now. @MsAshleeH
@EddieKupal did u heard @united just lost @HEELZiggler #intercontinentalchampiontitle cuz #Monday always a bad start
@AmericanAir I want to fill a complaint against American Airlines about the discrimination. flight delay and lost luggage suffered MCO MIA
@united bad experience on Flight 3742 tonite. Completely booked. many international travelers. Too many bags. Could see all bags not loaded.
@DeltaAssist I didn't have the money for a hotel room to leave tomorrow. No one is offering any assistance. I won't fly delta again.
@USAirways @AmericanAir really? Flt cancelled 12 HOURS ahead BC a crew issue?! Surely u have backup I mean that's y my friends r "on call"
I didn't think my travel experience could get any worse. Never flying @United again.
@ayeedamian @SouthwestAir that sucks assðŸ˜•
Lol @AmericanAir lost our bags for the second time😊😊😊😊
Ahh just another frustrating day flying @AmericanAir .  Why do I buy the ticket?  @SouthwestAir why can't they be like u? #luvswa #saynotoaa
I wish @JetBlue would've told me sooner about my flight delay. I would've had the time to get a Tlaloc burrito ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜²
@AmericanAir way to handle a major delay in Memphis. Two total ticket counters to re ticket a whole plane.
@DeltaAssist policy is inconvenient. Prevents me getting eBoarding pass unless I pay for seat assignment. Defeats purpose of online checkin.
Been on hold for 15 minutes with @united. No messages. just music. What an airline.
@united @flySFO Premier check in is now one big mess! Hire a new logistics manager asap..These are your best customers!
I get to my gate 10 mins b4 the gate closes &amp; @united tells me 10 mins b4 it closes they give my seat away! I was there! #worstairline ughhh
@AmericanAir not sure it keeps showing up as a received perk in my klout  but i never got anything
@AmericanAir #lame -- you change the schedule and don't let people cancel :-(
@united No one ever got back to me about my missing luggage.
Poor service from @united won't be flying with you again #shambles
@SouthwestAir per request. sent my RR # on Tues. after complaint about wifi. No response. Another flight today. still bad. New name "lie-fi"
@united on a 14 hour flight to Beijing from Newark supposed to leave at 12:55. no video system and electricity isn't running to seats!!?
@united no wifi on longer from ORD to LAX? Specifically #1218 last night. but the shorter #294 BUF to ORD did Made for a long 4 hour flight!
@united weather ain't ur fault.  How u handle it is!  2 hrs in IAH after flight from EWR to Aus diverted. But no comm/info That's on u!!
@united  stuck on tarmac for 1hr in@dsm so far countdown to fines has started..
@nselby @PrivacyDigest @united a kick in the groin with steel toed boots is better than flying United. U know the pain won't last for hours.
@Deltaassist I need help finding a reservation my mom made on the 14th.On hold w/customer service they are having technical issues help.
I arrived in Leeds yesterday. my suite case arrived today. @Delta @DeltaAssist #housemusic #acidhouse #travel #Lost http://t.co/yJ6XkoRQhR
@SouthwestAir wtf. First. our flight is switched out and pushed back to 8:15. Now sitting on the plane for 35 Mins! #fthis
@theregoesbabs shame on you @united this is totally inexcusable!!!!!!!! Poor dog.
For 3 weeks of weekly flights. @JetBlue has only let me down. So much for those JD Power customer service awards. #poorcustomerservice
@VirginAmerica your reset password website system is broken.  call hold wait = hour. This customer can't get help or help herself online.
@DeltaAssist my flight was cancelled to CHI and I was placed on DL0431 for tomorrow. Would you be able to get me out today?
.@JetBlue had ADVANCE knowledge of 1runway. 4+hr delays +existing price gouging. Unacceptable piss poor planning. I'd be out of a job.
@JetBlue the screen for my seat has been broken the whole flight #fail
TIL that if you pay $50 for @United Club access. they will NOT page you if your delayed plane is about to depart.  What the fuck?
Its a pitty that @AmericanAir gives Venezuela's customers so bad service. For years we were loyal customers #platinumaadvantage :(
@ZachMatari @united @TaylorGuitars it's their fault they broke it. they should fix it. â¤ï¸
Been waiting almost hour for @United airlines luggage. Guess there are no port authority chairmen on this flight. @mattkatz00 @AndreaWNYC
@AmericanAir Of course we tried that before waiting on hold for 2 hrs &amp; getting disconnected when put on hold again. Doesn't work.
@United terrible illogical re-route after cancelled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
Looks like @AmericanAir needs to treat their customers better. Horrible customer service.
@DeltaAssist I don't know - the main website. I have also called internationally. Why has nobody responded? I made my 1st complaint in Aug
@AmericanAir - please consider upgrading to system that calls your customers back. 2.5 hours on hold hurts the neck. http://t.co/wEcMxtnarj
Trapped on Tarmac in Vegas. waiting on a report to be written in Dallas!  Flight 3094 @SouthwestAir #flyinghell #wannagohome
Really @Delta!  I paid for a ticket and you have me as standby. then on a 20 min hold to resolve.  @DeltaAssist #fail
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
@united maybe you can help #ORD find a gate for #UA1435. We are waiting for 30 min on the Tarmac for our gate to open
1 tweet. I DM. and 4 phone calls later. still no word from @united 😠. #travelwoes #frustrated
@AndrewZamer I miss you!! You missed our date because of stupid @united! You were supposed to land 2 hours ago :(
Another delay... Hey someone from @united want to help here? This is becoming ridiculous.
I HATE that even when I buy Economy Plus on @united I can still board dead last with no overhead space left.
@AmericanAir  yet another delay after our original flight at 650 am. This flight supposed to leave @ 319 now 410! What about our students?
It's literally like 90 degrees in this plane! @united this is ridiculous
@AmericanAir @Qantas Which company would like to discuss my not only multiple occurring delayed baggage. but also damaged luggage? Cheers.
@BruceVentureXXX I think @JetBlue is my last resort. I hate that nickel and dime they do. @SouthwestAir is predictably good. Plus. points. 💰
@DCHomos @united   I'm horribly disappointed.  Are there any airlines anymore that haven't discriminated against somebody????
@AmericanAir you owe me. I've been stuck in Chicago since 1pm yesterday. I was supposed to get to my destination at 5pm yesterday. (1/2)
I expect better @VirginAtlantic! Been waiting 30mins @DeltaAssist reissue desk b/c "the systems don't talk to each other" some partnership
@americanair - worst customer service ever.  SHould it take 3 hours to book award seats?
I've been trapped on a @united plane on the tarmac for over 2 hours waiting for a gate to become available. 😡😡 never again
That's me pissed learning no WIFI on the flight to LA 4 bhetv biz....WTF @SouthwestAir got some tweets N Shit 2 send! http://t.co/eCBjye1JPH
Late...late...even later.  Will we ever leave Dallas @AmericanAir ?
@AmericanAir After waiting on hold for 1/2 hour. an AA CS rep told me that the best way to deal with my complaint was to “email every day.”
My @JetBlue #flight400 flight from MSY to BOS continues. Now reboarding in NOLA. 75 min after we were supposed to land in Boston. Mechanical
@yourpalal @JetBlue what?? That sucks
@AmericanAir has horrible policy. not employees. Dec 15 is your Cabo "Convenience" cut off date yet our hotel will not be open #disappointed
@DeltaAssist had a very disappointing flight on Monday 5/11 flight 472 JFK - San Fran. NO WIFI!!! Need to do work on a Monday morning.
@AmericanAir already had a 7 hour layover and now my flight has been delayed 3 times! #nothappy
@HannahKBrem @AlaskaAir you can claim for your delayed flight. Check to see if youâ€™re entitled to compensation- http://t.co/gspPqp8Diu
@SouthwestAir can you please rebook me asap!!  Missed my connection and need to get to map!!  From Chicago
Hey @VirginAmerica ! Can I port my @AmericanAir status &amp; miles over to you guys? AA is old. crusty and full of delays / excuses. I am done.
@united UA 3335 IAD-PHL: Ancient filthy plane. Last leg of $6000+ ticket from Narita. Fruit flies living on board. Totally unacceptable.
Flew with @united twice today and I've never experienced such terrible service while #travelling #badcustomerservice
@Gridlokp51sorry to hear about the shitty situation but ryan didn't you know @united is shit?
@DeltaAssist My full middle name isn't printed on my ticket like it is on my ID. is that a problem?
@DeltaAssist Saw a video with one of your flight attendants discriminating against a Muslim women and her 4 kids. I'll never fly delta again
@united airlines is the worst. They're all incompetent fuck ups and this is probably going to be my worst flight ever.
@JetBlue Very disappointed inyourcustomer service
@KelseyFolsom @Sia @united SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!! NEVER TRAVEL AGAIN WITH YOU
Big shame for http://t.co/4hzTLP5Ias - @united &amp; @Orbitz filing a lawsuit against the site: http://t.co/UuNcQsyOoE
Hey @DeltaAssist - DL1220 delayed over an hour. boarded with no pilot and sitting on the plane for 40+ mins. Angry customers everywhere!
Really hope I get 2 Buffalo tomro 4 #Raw ! Had 2  @AmericanAir flights cancel on me 2day due 2 maintenance! Now flight is @ 6am. #Prayers
@united The last 2 weeks I've flown wit u. you have given me 4 reasons to convince me it was a bad decision. Time 2 go back 2 @SouthwestAir
@JohnPaczkowski @waltmossberg @united has had crappy Gogo on p.s. for a couple years.They just announced deal on larger CR7 &amp; E175 rgnl jets
@united #fail premier status &amp; Chade card still got charged for bag.  Shoul have flown American
@NotCommonFacts @JetBlue not a good way to treat customers!
@JetBlue why did the $100 promised credit from flight 807 on march 17 get switched to $50 a week later? please explain
@JetBlue was a smooth flight from PDX to NYC. but strange. you have a flight a people waiting for their bags at carousel 4 :(
@DeltaAssist  I can see a wide open @AmericanAir gate. I bet it would fit this MD80! #dl2633 1.5 hours on tarmac.
after @united wanted to charge me 125 to get on an earlier flight then cancelled my original flight leaving me here for 8 hours never again
Never flying @AmericanAir or @USAirways again.
@united another late arrival.  We arrived fm PSP &amp; wait for gate 80 to open.  Better not miss my connection again!
@adevaratsinge @FrancandCo @AmericanAir And now waiting on bags. with not even 100 people waiting. AA &amp; #HSV not really worth it :(
Why is it that the only airline that can get out of CMH on time is @SouthwestAir ? @Delta you could learn from them. 1st day vaca ruined.
discrimination at its peak @united so pathetic how you all discriminate Muslims. ðŸ˜’ #UnitedForTahera
@AlaskaAir 50 mins at ORD to get my bag. No Alaska personnel to handle the complaint. So much for the 20min "guarantee" #badservice
3 of last 4 flights on @AmericanAir have had mechanical issues. #aggravating #getitogetherAA #notacceptable
You are a smart cookie. I heart Alaska. You will enjoy the switch. @JohnVogan1 @AmericanAir @AlaskaAir
â€œ@KeeganAllen: The worst airline in the world goes to @united and I know they take pride in that.â€ TRUE TRUE TRUE
Have been flying @united for decades. often. Recently I've been having such a bad experience I'm seriously considering a switch
If #cellphone causes trouble w/ #airlines why was the guy trapped in the @AlaskaAir plane able to call for help without troubling the plane.
I am never flying @Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom  they have lost then found then lost my luggage again. Now offered me $25. Smdh
@AmericanAir Been on hold 67 min!  Was offered chance earlier for call back in "58-68 minutes" -- really? That didn't happen so we try again
United Airlines Completes Rollout of Tarmac Transfer Service to All U.S. Hubs http://t.co/Egtur9OnGE @United
Someone didn't shower this morning. Three hours of olfactory assault forthcoming. Ugh. @united #flying #ripe #travel
@americanair I have a flight this eve (MMH -&gt; LAX) that I'm no longer taking. Can I transfer it to a friend?
@JetBlue I've been on hold now for 30 minutes trying to check my flight status because of the bad weather here in JFK. Please help!
@SouthwestAir I need to change flight dates from May to Sept - should I cancel May flight or wait till Sept flights open up to move?
@united UA maintenance issues strike again. Flt#106 delayed due to mechanical issue. Seems to be the norm rather than the exception lately.
.@AmericanAir my flight to Cleveland from O'Hare just got cancelled.  Can you rebook me?
@AmericanAir My flight tomorrow from SEA-AUS has been cancelled and my rebooking is unacceptable. Unable to get through on phone. plz advise
@DeltaAssist flight 1053. What is the status? App not working.
Hey @SouthwestAir what is the point of allowing me to check in online and them be told 2 secs before boarding I need a hard copy #bullshit
Dude! You're fucking feet stink! @AmericanAir #1237 http://t.co/kqO5JcgO8T
@united after 8-months of saying it's coming. still no #wifi on 3-hour ORD-MCO 6a flight?
The @united saga continues... Another engine check &amp; a delayed flight. Never mind that the plane has been sitting empty at #RSW for 4 hrs.
Was not sure about switching to @united. After my bag not making it on my flight for the second time this week my decision is firmly made.
@united #5582 delayed at ATL gate with no explanation from pilots. Lots of activity in cockpit. scurrying about.
Not loving @SouthwestAir at the mo. 9 people pulled off to reduce weight due to a fuel line problem. Everyone missing connections.
@AmericanAir I know that employees at the ticket counter get stressed but that's really no excuse to completely ignore someone trying (1/?)
@BuzzinMemphis fuck Delta. Get them out of here completely so more rational airlines like @FlyFrontier and @SouthwestAir can have a presence
my first @united experience in a while actually has me missing @delta (can't believe i just wrote that)
@united Yes. You can find my luggage. It's been missing for over 24 hours
On a @JetBlue flight during the super bowl with a broken TV...! #ugh #SB49 #SuperBowlXLIX
@Qantas that is complete transfer time. including monorail. Nothing like a stressful time with minimal info @AmericanAir
@united got triple charged $25 for the same bag. Was told to wait 21-29 days for a refund. Is that how your treat your customers?
@HOBART76 @SouthwestAir I should have never let someone convince me to fly something else #SouthWest
@united sucks! A flight delayed over 2 hours because you over booked a pilot? Unpleasant experience. Please get it together! #dontflyunited
@AmericanAir cancelled my flight &amp;lost a day in cali because of it. put me on a new flight which is 100$ cheaper and they won't refund me
@DianeNeal @united sad 2 say always issues w/them- flights cancelled due to no plane at gate twice within a month!
Think @united needs to fix their updates. My flight that was supposed to leave 15 min ago still shows "On Schedule."
@HUUUUGHES @SouthwestAir you have the worst luck with flying!
@Jaunted @AlaskaAir  We had a schedule change problem and Jordan was able to solve it within a very short time.  Alaska Airlines rocks
@JetBlue excited to book but frustrated and feeling bait and switch when final screen gets directs me to higher fare! http://t.co/LPKmo6H8qU
@JetBlue not selling gift cards anymore?? Wth! #frustrated #jetblue
@AmericanAir  Delay with flight 44 going out of JFK to CDG due to maintenance. Can you update a little on the maintenance issue?
Worst. Flight. Ever. Screaming children. inattentive parents. and tornado turbulence. @AlaskaAir. I've come to expect better from you.
@SouthwestAir my flight to Chicago was cancelled. and when I rescheduled. our early bird statuses disappeared. Can we get a refund?
Ugh @united you make no sense sometimes...
@united you should really stop delaying my flight
@Qantas flt late. No help thru customs; missed connection and all alts.  R they rly going to downgrade me on the rebooking on @AmericanAir?
@SCTrojan19 @VirginAmerica Save yourself the pain. Don't get a VA card until they switch from Comenity. They are awful. VA should be ashamed
Nose wheel steering problem. @AmericanAir 2574 @DFW ➡️ TYS. Can't take off yet. Mechanics are on the way out.... https://t.co/vnl10KKbme
@annaclendening @Delta is the worst.  Never fly delta. @SouthwestAir &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or nothing.
@united 2 canceled flights later. agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then canceled it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
@iamwill @united celebrity problems ay.... Turn it in Ya fucking nit!
@AmericanAir My flight from Little Rock to Dallas has been delayed &amp; changed 4 times. What is going on?! #frustratedcustomer
I just used @Delta @DeltaAssist call back system so I wouldn't sit on hold. They called back. and then I got minutes of on hold music...
so much trouble flying with @AmericanAir the past few days. And poor customer service. No resolution to issues. Very disappointed!
@AmericanAir so... My flight to the US was 1hr late. AA1160. Then you have a plane occupying a gate because they are working on it?
@united still waiting for my bag to be sent to my hotel four days after arriving in Europe... 😡😡😡 #findmybag ?
@DeltaAssist Just rec'd flight notification LGA to PBI. I thought you'd cancelled &amp; refunded my ticket?
@AmericanAir I just did that - but am missing a day trip to Disney in LA as a result.
super frustrated with the @jetblue website right now
Oh @JetBlue...making it easier to never fly again. You're now just another airline taking the luxury out of being a passenger. Dang.
@united terrible platform dropped me from flight twice on my trip. Don't fly this airline. They don't care about the customer only the $$$$$
Sadly @SouthwestAir lost my bag. So tonight I'll get shit faced and tomorrow I can worry about not having underwear for my road trip.
@AmericanAir Called and was told 2hr wait
Can the pilot make any more excuses? #seattlebostom @JetBlue
@AmericanAir i've been on hold for over an hour! help!
@AmericanAir My flight is cancelled and I want to be HOME before 7pm! Can you get me on USAIR 6491?Help! QQDOIR
#BoycottUnited  @united I did 100s of 1.000s of miles on your airline-I'll never fly yiu skies again! #EVIL  #ADASuit http://t.co/2gCHvAzHMc
@United it would be a miracle if you were ever on time.  3rd trip in a row with problems - last 2 canceled - this 1 delayed 1.5hrs so far
@JetBlue why the heck is nobody working the counter at San Diego airport for the next 2 hours?!?  We want to check our bags!
@SouthwestAir why. oh why. is the wait for my baggage at LGA longer than my flight from Chicago? Five flights on one luggage carousel????
Disappointed in the customer service of @VirginAmerica this morning.. Please retrain your attendants at the gate. Thanks. a paying customer.
Have been trying to contact @AmericanAir about a $400 overcharge on my account for two days to no avail. Worst thing ever.
Anyone ever have any issues ensuring your golf clubs show up at your final destination when travelling with connecting flights?@AmericanAir
@HEELZiggler @united dang United is that horrible
Seriously @SouthwestAir? You screw up boarding so we have to sit here delayed while you take roll? #wannagethome#itsmyanniversary
Bummed to read @JetBlue adding bag fees and reducing leg room. No favorites anymore. Sad
.@AmericanAir Please help @jimconviser! Can't believe it has been 6 weeks with no reply. #FAIL https://t.co/IPgEmap35b
@SouthwestAir @united @AmericanAir @Delta Southwest best airline ever! No Change fees!! All the rest gauge consumers!! #Ripoff
@MrSilverScott @SouthwestAir I guess you need to be a "celebrity" in order for that to occur. They suck! I would NEVER fly them again...
@kristen @united United airlines should be ashamed of the behavior of this flight attendant!! I hope someone is looking into this matter!!
Never again @AmericanAir . never again
Terrible service @DeltaAssist spending 6 more hours in Florida- wish it wasn't a surprise so we weren't trapped in the terminal/ w. No help
@JetBlue worst flight in long time.6hrs from JFK - BUR.Flight delayed.No tv.No wifi.Tried to keep sane for the longest flight. #notthenorm
@united please help. 2 lost bags. &gt;24hrs no update. Tracking not working. DM so I can provide tracking info.
@JetBlue fly-fi great as usual.  But disappointed that my tv didn't work http://t.co/Q42OtKgZIq
@chrisodonnell @AlaskaAir That's not good. I hope for you that they find it!!
@eric_bolster I've been on the Tarmac for over 3hrs with other airlines. I would say 30 min is a blessing @AmericanAir
.@americanair u rebooked my flight but when I call to change it your sys won't left me be put on hold to talk to agent. what's up with that?
@AmericanAir on booking NYC-LPB. I have 2 ridiculous choices. layover 12 hours or 55 minutes!
Finally boarding. Kudos to @AlaskaAir folks. who kept bad situation (not their fault) from getting worse. Future discounts for  passengers.
Can't believe how incompetent @united is and how uncaring and inflexible their customer service desk is.
@DeltaAssist realtime status updates recommended when flights are being delayed. I paid how much for this plane to be late?
@AmericanAir 4285 due in to STL 12:02.  Arrived 10 early.  Just pulling in to gate now 12:33 pm.  Poor job by pilot on updates
@annabellekline @JetBlue mines been not working since this afternoon.
@AmericanAir First they cancelled my flight from Houston to Dallas and We took  another flight that was also late we lose our connexion ....
@kufavs @advertisingweek I’m very upset Santa didn’t bring me an upcycled @SouthwestAir bag for Christmas.
The @AmericanAir flight from Houston to DFW is 40 min. The way out here was delayed 1 hr. and so far it's 15 min today. How is this so hard?
Our flight reservation was arbitratrily cancelled by @United. And they don't even know why. LOL United is a joke airline. Never again.
@DeltaAssist @Delta Yall new medallion requirements for 2015 is really some bullshit for the record!
@AmericanAir flight 295. mia to lax. 1 1/2 hours for bags to arrive for whole flight. Still waiting
@nickyromero @SouthwestAir | FUCK !
@SouthwestAir you're ruining my evening with no WIFI on flight 161... I want to watch the a World Series!!! Please send updates to the pilot
How unprofessional is @united . They have been changing my flight and gates like crazy!!! Such a mess
@USAirways @AmericanAir Why are my FF accounts no longer matched?
First time flying @virginamerica. What a ripoff. Everything is overpriced and just bad. $30 for super slow internet. crappy food.
@AmericanAir @British_Airways I am in bound from Detroit to Dallas and getting AA78 - don't leave with out me. will be close though!
@AmericanAir and now I've been on hold for twenty minutes after you dropped my call
@heatherdopson @SouthwestAir That stinks :(
@SouthwestAir internet that is supposed to work but never does?
@AmericanAir I know I'm responding late but you messed up the date on return flight admitted it and still charged me to switch her flight
@erinedok @AmericanAir seriously. 1.5 hours late.
@SouthwestAir My wife is stuck in Greenville Flight 31/1456 Had to pay 200 dollars more to move the flight to the 24th can't get thru phone
@AmericanAir get your shit together on Gold check in line at #MIA airport no people working long line to check in
Lost all hope with @JetBlue - no water until we're in the air. broken TV. and no updates for hours. What is this - Spirit? #NoThanks
@AmericanAir you guys suck
Flight gets cancelled on a Sunday and #AmericanAirlines can't get me home until Tuesday night?! @AmericanAir you suck #wtfamerica
And now. my @AmericanAir flight's delayed until 11:30 pm. Original plane out if service for mechanical issue.
@AmericanAir a complete circus at Vegas airport. Now delayed over an hour on plane due to "waiting for paperwork" before taking off.
@SouthwestAir just called me 12 hours before my flight to tell me it was cancelled. and my agent had the personality of a cardboard box. 👎
My first @virginamerica was 4 hours delayed on Monday. my return journey delayed at least 30mins #fail #neveragain
@AmericanAir u have made this an unbelievably difficult trip. After a week in St Thomas only 2 deal w/ ur nonsense all over again 2 get home
Shame on @united for kicking off an autistic girl. Those flight attendants should be fired!!! #discrimination  http://t.co/9OSi7nxb6Z
What's the point of having barcodes to scan on bag tags if you don't use them @SouthwestAir your system is the worst. #wheresmyluggage
@DeltaAssist delayed on DL3756. Am I going to make DL2163?
@JetBlue Ok The fairy flight delay has been lifted. I need an ATC clearance before I take off-Tonight i am fairy flying from ORH to FLL
@AmericanAir Only preferred seating?Either don't sell me the ticket or give me a seat! Have to check in at LAX. waste of everyone's time.
@united it does and did. But that didn't stop the attendant from making lines of people wait while we each tried it out. Terrible logistics.
@AmericanAir Called 800-433-7300 1st - On hold for 2+ hrs with no agent responding ever. Had to physically drive to terminal for any help.
@AmericanAir charging Platinums to re-deposit miles or change airports within a market in same direction is Bad Policy &amp; in bad taste 😡
@AmericanAir 260 is delayed &amp; lands in DFW @9. 2249 to LA boards @ the same time. Put the fancy command center to work and #holdtheplane
@AmericanAir is the worst. Flights from gate D3 at Laguardia leave Terminal B. Way to make chaos! Warn passengers. No wonder I fly @Delta.
My Find My Phone app found my phone at the airport but @Delta and @DeltaAssist say it is still lost. Tomorrow I storm the barricade!
@EddieTrunk @united and yet the "budget" airline @SouthwestAir gives you TV and snacks . I hate united and usairways is same as united
HEY @United- MOST PPL LIKE PETS MORE THAN PPL! #FAIL  Passengers complain after dog left on rainy tarmac @NYPost   http://t.co/xipqIhasat
The "September 11th" security fee is the greediest thing done by @SouthwestAir ..... Mannn fuck outta here
@united why 15 people deep waiting to get into redcarpet club EWR really slow check in http://t.co/QkeZyds3l9
@DeltaAssist do people get refunds for flights delayed 3 times?
@AmericanAir  Why oh why does it seem like your flights are always delayed?  Might need to take some cues from @Delta!!
@DeltaAssist damaged lug. Went to baggage services &amp;was told theyre not liable for it. Had to convince rep to file a claim. No call. Nothing
@cnnbrk this is the 80th time something REALLY bad has gone wrong with @SouthwestAir! I DO NOT allow my kids or family to fly them!
I specifically chose to fly @SouthwestAir home. and here I am. sitting on the tarmac in Chicago for 45 mins on an already delayed flight.
@JetBlue My iPad that was in a strong protective case had it's screen broken on my flight to Puerto Rico...
Going crazy for Saturday night.  And by going crazy. I mean waiting on hold for several hours with @AmericanAir #mykindofparty
@united never disappoints with the rudest flight attendants in the business.
So @united not only changed the time of my flights but also choose bad seats and separated us for the long flights.And now I can't change it
@United 2pax on 2diff inbound flights to SFO; u managed 2lose BOTH sets of bags! Line 20+ deep 2report in person; on hold 1hr+ now. Help?

@virginamerica. is it me or is multi city functionality broken at the moment? i only have 2 cities &amp; can't add another..
@AmericanAir need urgent help with rebooking a flight for my mother that was just cancelled. Sent a DM.
And situations like the plane sitting on the runway for 8 hours is why you NEVER fly @united. esp if you fly international.
@united wtf w/splitn our reserv and givin us 2 middle seats when we had 2 aisle booked mnths ago n not even 2gether!? #mileageplus #nothappy
@AmericanAir Trying to book a military fare. Waited 30 min. for auto callback and disconnected when answered. #frustrating #justwantahuman
@AmericanAir been waiting two hours to pull out from my gate cause there is a "shift change for baggage personnel" to load the plane. BS!!
Will NEVER again fly @united! We'll be flying @SouthwestAir from now on!
@southwestair over last 5 days 3 phone calls have ended with "leave your number and we'll call you back in 15 minutes" still waiting.
@SouthwestAir data around very delayed #2156 tonight was a mess. First. not on Arrivals screen at @cak at all. No way to know delayed.
@United Leave Aktarer Zaman. alone.  Don't screw him like you screwed over your own employees.
Fight in Salt Lake delayed a million hours. I'm sad. Are there cocktails in this airport? #nonmormonproblems #wheresthewhiskey @SouthwestAir
@British_Airways  &amp; @AmericanAir YOU SUCK day 13 you still can't work together to get my bag to me! #frustrating #worsecustomerservice
Just curious @SouthwestAir why you announce 15 min #762 delay. then rescind delay. only to announce onboard a 40 min delay? #nothappy
Disappointed in @AmericanAir. Response should be to do something about that 2yr wait list for service dogs in MI: http://t.co/8sbUSarVVU
@AmericanAir used seg to upgrade. Granted. Then the plane changes &amp; I'm downgraded. #NotCool #HonorIt
@JetBlue is making me feel really blue right now by delaying my flight till 5am. Guess im sleeping in San Juan airport tonight
@americanair carryon baggage size decreases. frustration increase. full bins is a lame excuse because my flight had empty overhead bins.
I've never been treated disrespectful on an @AmericanAir flight until today AA4345 by Audreu Pinnix #worstservice #fail
Stuck in DFW because @AmericanAir doesnt have airplanes that aren't broken.Gate agent is rude and unhelpful. HELP! #AmericanAirlines #AA5792
I'll never fly @AmericanAir again they are rude as hell goodbye #DIA
@AmericanAir Why is it better 2 leave 1st class seat open than give it 2 gold AA member who asks 4 it? Why insist on charging 4 the upgrade?
@AmericanAir IF YOU LOST @JacobWhitesides I WILL FIND YOU
I really don't know how @united calls something first class with no TV. Power. or Internet on a 8 hour flight. I'd like a refund!
@SouthwestAir why are people changing their babies holding up my flight and making the plane smell. This has happened twice this week.
@DeltaAssist: One absent FA shouldn't = a 2.5 hr delay. No backup? No compensation? This isn't force majeure. it's amateur hour. #flight3753
Planes broken can't get out. @AlaskaAir
@WeeklyChris @AmericanAir that was rude of themðŸ˜¡
@SouthwestAir fail for communication at Oakland airport #zero patience
@AmericanAir sent a few DMs. I need your help with flight 2day. hoping u can help rectify lie customer service told me. for return flight.
.@SouthwestAir - Why is flight 2589 PHX to LAX delayed? Second delay tonight. A little unhappy.
@DeltaAssist Hung up on twice...flight delayed ... Missed connection and delta thinks I made my flight. Terrible service. Get digital delta.
Just receive a call from @AmericanAir canceling my flight scheduled for 6:45 am. There is always something negative. #TimeToMoveOn
Still waiting for bag after 40 minutes. So glad I paid for the honor @USAirways @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist help! Flight 2333 has been delayed and I am going to miss my connector. There are no later flights!!!!
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 30 minutes two separate times. Nobody working your phone's? #Frustrated
@united New priority check-in at SFO is a joke.  30+ United people standing around. no help on ridiculous new process. Time for a change.
What does @Delta and @DeltaAssist do when you are harassed? They put you and your kids on the back of the plane. http://t.co/pmIohmRyKL
@AmericanAir Just once. I'd like to see a bird get sucked n2 the engine of my plane. Can you keep pigeons handy for this? # birdsofafeather
@SouthwestAir any reason for extensive delay for 1568 LGA-MKE?
Hey @AmericanAir I can't check in for my flight &amp; the reservations # isn't even taking calls? Gave up after 2 hrs on hold last night
@DeltaAssist  2 hour current wait time to speak to a rep. #thatsnotservice
Very upset with @united for cancelling my flight &amp; effectively adding 8 hours onto my travel time 2 days before Christmas.
@united rudest customer service ever!  Learn how to treat loyal customers.
@JetBlue Exactly. that credit was from when you screwed up my flight the previous month. You have given me nothing for the second screwup
Are you joking @united 1st I have to switch planes.then "on board app" doesnt work with kindle fire?? So I buy internet cant use netflix.
@VirginAmerica trying to find people on this flight.... we were supposed to leave half an hour ago #badservice
Seriously @AmericanAir ??? No TV screens on a 5 hour international flight? Not pleased.
@AmericanAir has the worst customer service in the industry!
@SouthwestAir Having miserable time trying to get a hold of someone at southwest and unable to rebook anything for next two days. Awful.
Never again will I fly @FrontierCorp or what I like to call Nickel and Dime Airlines. It's @SouthwestAir out of Denver for me from now on!
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒
@michellevisage @Delta @DeltaAssist I think Michelle may have got her hair stuck in the overhead compartment...?
@JetBlue thanks just called and rep got the same we're experiencing technical problem message when she searched for flight using points
For the record. not a fan of Southwest Airlines. I miss my @VirginAmerica flights.
.@united Are you going to discipline Lisa Chamberlain for stealing my friend's kindle? EPIC FAIL.
@united so 2015 won't be better according to this article? Still at the bottom of operational issues I see http://t.co/rmZVQqLZBm
Last night @SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica  flights to @flySFO were delayed at least 2hrs. My 'magic' @AlaskaAir flight was on time!
@united medical because of You.I've never slept since your words.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to go home since Sunday. but you guys keep having maintained issues. Who do I speak to so I can get a refund
36hrs. still no bags “@AmericanAir: Austan. we show all 5 bags out for delivery. They avg 6 hrs to deliver. but are experiencing delays.”
@JetBlue Tx. On hold for 30+ min. Any other thoughts?
Ruh-roh. The airlines are mad. Stop the world. Hidden-city ticketing yields savings. prompts suit by @united @Orbitz  http://t.co/sb6qNwwGVH
I'm sleepy &amp; it's midnight... Work ur magic. @SouthwestAir... Pls hurry w/ our delayed luggage! 30 min is too long! http://t.co/ow4qfHukHv
.@DeltaAssist I'm not flying on your airline today. The @warriors were. but they were delayed 5 hours by your poorly maintained plane.
@NBA I wish we did but once again the @SouthwestAir late night flight to Indy is delayed. #overandoverandover
@SuzieQJones @VirginAmerica calling you out again. Sitting in #SF w/5 hour delay w/no email warning? BC runway const. @ JFK. Really?
@SouthwestAir totally sucks cancels all flights LAX to Chicago!!! What up?
@SpiritAirlines since the flight experience is possibly the worst I've ever experienced. isn't it time to learn from the masters @JetBlue ?
@AmericanAir I had a really bad experience with your staff both at PIT airport and phone...somehow no one could get me on plane.
@DeltaAssist Need help with a cancelled flight
Worst customer service @united ! Been on hold 30 min and spoke with 3 and zero answers! #nowaytotreatmilagecustomer
@librarianista @AmericanAir nope. just sitting on another tarmac w @united
@AmericanAir if you're going to make me sit on the Tarmac. your flight attendants should be willing to take my money when I ask to buy food
I am very disappointed by @VirginAmerica's response to my shattered bubble helmet. Instead of making good they offered a tiny flight credit.
@SouthwestAir this is my second flight in less than a month and again it is delayed. Why? F#556 to ATL. #help
@DeltaAssist worst customer service. On hold for 50 mins and person who finally answered unable to help-5yo cant sit alone. DM'd my confirm#
My @united flight to LA had no electricity for passengers. My flight home has mechanical issues. Seems like it's time for improvement.
Dear @virginamerica it sucks to pay for a â€œdirectâ€ flight but have to stop to refuel. Who designed these flying turkeys anyway?
Hey @AmericanAir you are the worst please get it together
Three hours now stuck on runway @LaGuardiaCC  @southwestair Isn't the @FAANews Federal limit at FOUR hours? #thesmellistough
@JulianaDesiree @AmericanAir kick some ass
http://t.co/QZyR5UXh3e @SouthwestAir gets my business from now on. We were STARVING on @AmericanAir (US Airways) in CLT on the runway.
@united @andrewzimmern  - they never ever tell you why you sit there!!!!!  United policy - NO communication!!! Happens every time!
While delayed. a flt attnt just went row by row to ensure all phones were still in Airplane Mode. Quoting "rules are rules" @AmericanAir
@LANURSE1 @AmericanAir I lost my bag once I arrived back at DFW. It took them 95 days to pay for the Bag that disappeared.
@SouthwestAir delayed flight. again. land at 5:35 con. leaves at 5:40. Lady on phone rudely said to "run for it." she couldn't help. Sad.
$450 round trip from Fl to OH in mid October. plane tickets are ridiculous @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
will never fly with @united after the racist and islamophobic treatment of young muslim woman tahera ahmed today #BoycottUnitedAirlines
@JetBlue was a pain in the ass this morning. Took forever to get through baggage. unhappy flight attendants
Terrible treatment from @Qantas this morning!! @AmericanAir
Disgusting! I will NEVER fly @united AGAIN! 🙅🏽👎🏾 https://t.co/KJE3iibK9r
The @united married segment logic that impacts upgrade available space is annoying - http://t.co/xARmp6Eb6P
Dear @VirginAmerica. you know I know you know I've been lookin at flights to #Tulum. quit foolin with the price to mess with my feelings. ðŸ˜¡
So annoyed we were de-planed and not provided any info on when we can get back on to fly out? @SouthwestAir
@united you have ruined your last trip for me. Multiple delays and now just sitting. I will miss my next flight. My vacation is ruined.
Glad I'm 5'2... Who needs wifi to work. or wants to watch a movie since there is no wifi? #UnitedFail @united http://t.co/raBrtpyHY1
No @united club lounge at Manchester England airport. Very disappointed. Guess I need to fly Delta.
Back on hold with @AmericanAir  to see if they can give me any update on where my bags might be. You know. from back on Thanksgiving.
@whislerrr16 @hindukid1021 @DeezyBOfficial @united literally 1% of muslims are radicals shut the fuck up
@united overbooked out of Newark to Syracuse and delayed 3 hours #unitedstinks #badservice #unreliable  #theydontcare #flydeltanexttime
@SouthwestAir I wish i would've seen this 4 hours ago!!! I WANTED TO SEE THEM TONIGHT SO BAD!!!! #CRYING
@AmericanAir when is your company going to integrate. Missed a rare flight out of DFW because my ticket couldn't be transferred #stranded
More reason to fly @southwestair JetBlue ushering in sad. new era and risks alienating its loyal passengers -   http://t.co/HL1N8fFLSP
http://t.co/GBXjGaIyPs @united never again.
@lizzilaw @AmericanAir that's terrible! I'm not flying on them either. Never had my luggage lost. Knock on wood.
@AmericanAir Awful first experience AA tonight (LHR-ORD) - BA Gold - cancelled flight (sorry delayed to 9am. same thing) - missed meeting
I've been on hold for over one hour on the phone w @united they won't give me a full refund for illness in spite of dr's note
@SouthwestAir wrong #fail
@DeltaAssist Where can I mail a written complaint?  Delayed bags on back to back flights to me is an unacceptable service standard !!!!
@united this is really becoming a joke... I hope I am being #punked and this seriously isn't your poor customer service. #really
Still waiting. RT @united: @herreraylozano  We're sorry to hear this. Is there something we can assist you with here? DM any details. ^KP
@DeltaAssist I find a flight I want on your site. switch to Miles view. then the flight disappears. What to do? Can't use my miles?
WHO DOES THIS?? MT @MichelleLudtka: To the man clipping his finger nails two seats ahead of me... You're disgusting. @AlaskaAir
It's been problem after problem after problem with @USAirways and @AmericanAir I'll be damned if I fly with them again smh
Hey @AmericanAir. your Cust. Service Dept. has blown me off I asked for a call back and all I got was an so sorry email. #badservice
@AmericanAir Do you know what the word tomorrow means? Agent clearly said tomorrow when rebooking now online it says monday On hold for 1h
@AmericanAir except that they aren't. Want to have a word with them to tell them? Communication seems to be an issue for you guys...
@thedeadblog @JetBlue my dad huge grateful dead fan was disappointed to know that we were flying Delta in August lol
@united my bf @sammywilk needs his luggage get ur shit together
@united wants to charge me $90 to renew my expired miles haha how about I pay $0 and never fly you again #fail
@united  lost my luggage twice. I missed my flight bc the 1 teller they had at MAF was in the back searching for lost luggage for 45mins.
I have booked my last @SouthwestAir flight. Last minute flight cancelation for a 6 am flight sent at 10 PM night before flight. Awful!
@AmericanAir Disagree. There was no unusual traffic that day&amp;just because u r employee is running late. a whole plane shouldn't wait. He ...
@omarsuleiman504 @united disgusting from United. Fix up.
.@SouthwestAir. you already cancelled my flight 2morrow. rest of the day's flights are booked. I now have to take a vacay day. (1/2)
@united is responding to other complaints but ignoring the racial and disgusting behavior on their airline.
@SouthwestAir friend stuck in airport at MCO bc of weather and they are refused their luggage to go ahead and just drive home.Seriously?!
Plane pushes back at 4:30. turns around and then pilot says DFW doesn't want us to leave until 5:15 p.m. What's wrong. @AmericanAir?
@SouthwestAir hey anyone covering the phones- on hold forever
@AmericanAir why was AA 2643 from ORD to Charlottesville cancelled today?  My cousin sat at the airport for 9 hours.
@DeltaAssist my flight out of PUS has been cancelled. How do I speak with someone about alternatives? Can someone please call me?
@ImamSuhaibWebb @YourAnonNews @united this is sick. The people on this place are the reason why everyone in the world hates Americans.
@lufthansa Pilots in strike. now I have to fly with @united. which is again a horrible experience that starts with the check-in already
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines  Flight 1179 Miami to DC. Gate closes at least 19 minutes before the flight. Agents show up and lie to me.
@AmericanAir AA staff at VCP airport finally returned to me in the end of March... but problem still open. Bad response time
@united The pilot on flight 24 hrs later on Sunday Lima to Houston. 24 hour flight delay due to mechanical and the promised gift won't work
@united have you read? nicely sums up why I'm switching over to @VirginAmerica http://t.co/khgxAYlktC
@SouthwestAir "Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online" FYI - your phone system not working #HELP
Having the worst experience with @AmericanAir in Denver. Waiting 7 hours to notify passengers of a NEXT DAY flight delay is unacceptable!
@SouthwestAir I never received my refund for the slow moving wifi
@AmericanAir seeing as dm got no response I'll try here. My seats for 2yr. olds are gone now. Calling was no help
@DeltaAssist My first flight is 45 minutes delayed. I may be missing my connecting flight - have been on hold for 29 minutes now
@DeltaAssist sadly. it's too late for today....I am already on the plane.
As usual @DeltaAssist standing by a gate with a sign saying flight was to depart 1 min ago. and no info updates from gate agents. Poor.
Waiting for our ski bags at SeaTac... 20min bag guarantee didn't work @AlaskaAir... Flight 2477 landed 40mins ago. http://t.co/1PlHpcktYP
@McGinsuknife @united the question is. what doesn't happen. I can't even complain after seeing the news abt the austic child they kicked off
@DeltaAssist standing in line at Orlando MCO waiting for someone to check bags no delta employee here less then an hour before boarding
@united  I do still need assistance (still on hold).  What is the best way to get my issue resolved?
@DeltaAssist any idea what's going on with flight DL5240.. It's been delayed 4x.. Was supposed to leave at 12:15. ATL to GSO.
@SouthwestAir @dbiemesderfer we've now been on Tarmac for two hours. but sat at gate for one hour before that. This is beyond ridiculous.
@AlaskaAir we didn't miss the flight. They were not going to hold the flight and were rude n unprofessional
@AmericanAir what did you chg me for? You cancelled my res and I couldn't get in contact with an agent for 3d WCT8952 http://t.co/TgT4URqQa5
Stuck at #MSPAIRPORT because #Delta can't locate its crew @Delta @DeltaAssist #notacceptable #nomoredelta
@JetBlue Aside from delaying my flight over 28 hours and keeping me on hold for 20+ minutes?
@AmericanAir Still no response and still "pending review" for ticket 0012397758987.  Can you please help it's been over 2 weeks
@AmericanAir now this site said a manager would contact me. That was yesterday. Only been waiting since Tues. AA doesn't care about cust.
@AmericanAir I've never been so disappointed in service &amp; after today I'll be reconsidering my airline loyalty &amp; who I fly wkly
@AmericanAir has the WORST customer service and is ruining my holiday. I should have been home hours ago.
@acdaum @AmericanAir what a mess... Total lack of respect of people's time. #frustrating
Disappointed @AmericanAir service again. gate agents forced me to check my bag when half of the overhead compartments were full
@Delta is seriously the worst. someone should sue them for making adverstisements like this @DeltaAssist http://t.co/OOwIfOUq7Y
@united close to 4 hours delayed because of maintenance but now the reason is a delayed inbound flight. Not quite the true story.
@SouthwestAir ... how long are your backed up on the phone? Been waiting for an hour and a half now?
I've experienced a lot of bad service with @united but nothing at this level #hate #getmeoutofhere
@VirginAmerica - Somebody screwed the pooch on tonight's flight 34 out of @flySFO. I hope you make good for the people on that flight...
@AmericanAir Your system for tracking flight information is severely broken.  It is almost comical at this point.
@kljordan88  @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir Wanted me to pay 200 dollars to switch my 185 dollar flight. Im just leaving it idol and booked SW.
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
Delta flight 766 tonight - worst flight attendants ever.   @DeltaAssist
@JetBlue in my stressful flight last night from SFO to JFK at gate A12 I may have left my DL.  Let me know if one was found.
@CRMLady Too late. we're at our destination. No WiFi and only one Lav tho. Sharpen up @delta! @deltaassist
I will never ever ever fly @united again &amp; I am 10000% sure everyone else on my flight won't either! Worst flight EVER!
Delta airline  rule sucks and worst customers service never fly again @DeltaAssist @Delta
@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime. Auto Vmsg:"your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!
There's a @SouthwestAir flight delayed 1 1/2 automatically give away $100 voucher to everyone. &lt;3
Terrible service @AmericanAir no mobile app no website no phone help. Cancel flights &amp; no way to contact airline #airnightmare
@AmericanAir is the worst!!  They broke my bag &amp; won't help me. I will do my best to never fly with them again #lame
@l0ftzilla @AJFeather How does arriving early mean you're late? @SouthwestAir @USAirways

@JetBlue your widget to see if a flight tomorrow has fly-fi isn't working. it's stuck on today's date. also. amazonprime thing up &amp; running?
@SouthwestAir cancelled and uncancelled our flight TWICE #whatajoke
@AmericanAir Flight #2237 delayed because they forgot to unload the baggage from incoming flight. Pilot said he was embarrassed of AA.
@AmericanAir doesn't care about customer retention.  Contacted them 5 days ago about terrible experience.  No response.  Sad
@southwestair your wifi blacklist is incorrect. you shouldn't block http://t.co/2ujq0zYlFL it has nothing to do with watching videos. #fail
@united Reviewed other tweets. Not sure if you can do anything except write heart warming tweets while other United members create mess
Really disappointed in @SouthwestAir front desk service. Much apathy. so disappoint. Wow. @JetBlue really is the only good U.S. Airline.
.@united agent offers voucher for poor experience but transfers me to apparently closed office leaving me to hold for 50 mins #united #fail
@VirginAmerica yes. I did sign up for your flight alerts feature but it never came

@AmericanAir my bag never arrived off my flight last night... You then managed to deliver someone else's bag to me this evening... Really???
Shame on @United Airlines for kicking a family off the flight for autism issue. Your crews should be better trained. https://t.co/DdTfcaFlFx
@AmericanAir. after 30 mins on the DFW tarmac. can u get AA1602 moved to another gate in C term? Connections and appts remain.
@SouthwestAir your airline is positively kak.  I hope I never have to use you again.
@jdonelan @AmericanAir @united careful James @JetBlue apparently kicks you off a flight for tweeting about delays http://t.co/Y91xYSGTGf
@united But I didn't know the dates. Now you guys had no option to reschedule with out a date and hence I had to cancel #dissapointing
@DeltaAssist your app has been terrible. Kicked off again. Wouldn't take my pass word (same as always) and now I can cant on unless I call
@WorkplaceDr @audrawashington send your complaint to @AmericanAir  the merger is complete and they need to hear that a HUB is not performing
.@United robbed me by downgrading my seats at the gate and refuses to issue a refund.@USDOT http://t.co/PznZDS1xH9
Never again @AmericanAir. Never again.
What has happened to @Delta? Used to enjoy flying them. but @RockOrphan and I have vowed the switch to @JetBlue starts after this trip. #LGA
@JFK_Int_Airport  I lost my wedding ring in line for security for @VirginAmerica AR Terminal 4.  Please help!!! #jfk #lostweddingring

@AmericanAir my flight has gotten canceled for and i have been on hold for 45minutes trying to re-book. I need to get home. HELP PLEASE
@united  This is my first time flying your airline.  Thought your First Class might be better than USAir/American.  No flight attendant
@AmericanAir Terrible service. I've missed my flight to Shreveport. is there any way I could get there ASAP?
Might avoid ORD &amp; @united in the future. Delayed flight 5234. 30 min sitting at gate b/c "dispatch &amp; ATC not talking" &amp; 20 min taxiing! Bad.
@united 1st you kick of kid on spectrum. now crying kids. You are awful. @Autism @autismspeaks
@SouthwestAir @united @AmericanAir so like on a scale of 1-10 how much shit do you guys take on any given day #tougherthanjosswhedon
@AmericanAir In two trips from the VI to AZ you have lost my bags 3 times and destroyed 1 bag. Why should I give you another chance?
.@AmericanAir how do you/@USAirways cancel flights 48 hours before departure for "weather" when the weather forecast is rosy &amp; dry?
So how does the Maid of Honor end up in Miami. but her luggage (including the dress) end up in Charlotte? Flying @AmericanAir #fail
@united flight was cancelled on me again. Left us without wheelchair service on the way over and cancelled flights both in and out of #ALB
@VirginAmerica flight is cancelled. customer service hold time 2 hours?! How am I supposed to rebook?!
@DeltaAssist I'm rebooked to leave at 4:20 to MSP and trying to select my seat and it won't let me. Can you help?
@united Columbus oh baggage dept not operating.  United attendants poor communication.
@united I'm going to miss my connection to MSP because of mechanical problems.  Is there a later one to MSP?
step up your game @SouthwestAir - your wifi is slow and worthless
@AmericanAir this isn't weather issues. We had a death in family and simply were trying to replan trip. We couldn't get help from cust svc
Thanks @VirginAmerica for canceling my flight. It's not even raining in San Fran yet! Great client impression w/ me not showing up. #Fail
Sitting in Munich - continue to marvel at fact any @lufthansa lounge puts every @united red carpet club to shame.
@JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay
Once again. @AmericanAir fails to update passengers about flight delays. #LeftWondering #PoorCommunication
@AmericanAir double whammy... Back on an airplane with no AC and a broken auxiliary. It does get worse
@JetBlue my missing luggage was found and delivered to me a couple hours ago. Quite a relief!
@DeltaAssist I book ALL my trip with you.Yesterday 1St class.flight canceled they put me on @AirCanada on ECO. IM STILL WAITING FOR LUGGAGE
@united I never got such a bad and grumpy stewardess! Told me she wont pick up the tray as she was tired! What happen with #customerservice
@VirginAmerica Lost my baggage - called the baggage claim office and had two conflicting responses. Clearly they didn't check for me.
@AlaskaAir Your departure updates are a joke. Just got an update that my flight is leaving in 5 minutes when gate just told me 1:30 delay
And @AmericanAir does it again. Let's see how delayed we get this time and if I can make the connecting flight
@SouthwestAir  my flight. flight 1554 was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. we now won't get to Atlanta till 9pm instead of 1pm
@united  There seems to be an issue with your new M+ app. Can't log in or see any items. http://t.co/2CPnsc0kmM
@AmericanAir My aircraft was just taken out of service.  Can you help me with rebooking?
@AmericanAir dfw-lit late because of inbound. then board. then wait 46 min+ &amp; counting b/c no ramp ppl to load bags. Too often w eagle.
Hopping on a sky-chariot to #Dallas today via @AmericanAir! Can't wait to walk @MassChallenge at @DFWStartupWeek! #JibblesTexasRanger
@CMPunk @AmericanAir yeah fuck American Air
I persevered and navigated @AmericanAir mobile site's many #usability issues. hit submit at the last step and boom http://t.co/EYTgXTwauz
@thekapman @AmericanAir  And that's why American business sucks.
@SarahBlackwood1 @united @Discrimination @Thisissoridiculous We all should boycott @United What safety issue maybe passengers complained
@SouthwestAir Business trip to Vegas and flight cancelled ... Sitting on standby hoping to catch the next one in THREE hours ...
@SouthwestAir help!! Stuck in Atlanta :(
@AlaskaAir I'm an MVP &amp; extremely disappointed with my check in at LAX for #701. My only positive is Kathryn in the Boardroom. Please help.
.@SouthwestAir flight 2168 delayed no clear information on the new flight to Denver #poorservice #deboarded flight due to maintenence issue
@lilschwartzie @mellushix @united GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. UNITED!!!!
Sat on runway 2hr+1hr delay on@Delta.Wish my old colleague who whined for dayz about a 40min delay on @americanair endured it instead.#karma
@SouthwestAir  no both we're out of service on the flight from San Jose to Portland or
Thumbs down @SouthwestAir ðŸ‘ŽðŸ½ No wifi on the plane &amp; my little guy was so heartbroken he couldn't watch his TMNT!
@AlaskaAir I am _extremely_ disappointed that you dropped your early morning nonstop from ONT to SEA. The thing was always full! Why?!?
Despite confused and late @Uber driver made my @AlaskaAir flight with 1 min to spare. #iFlyAlaska
@AmericanAir. delayed departure by 1.5 hours because of a lost LOG book. seriously!? Terrible.
@AmericanAir yall suck
@united terrible
Another trip. another delayed @SouthwestAir flight.  Yay. &lt;sigh&gt;
Calling @United to change a reservation: ‘your wait time will be 50 minutes’ 1/2
@ryangrannand @Catinellaa8 @JetBlue Oh pooh. They were my favorite airline for a long time. Guess no longer...
@AmericanAir @USAirways So my flight is delayed 5+ hours in Charlotte because you can't find a flight attendant?  Really?
Heard great things re: @VirginAmerica but...no agents to check bag. late take off. pander-y safety video and this: http://t.co/4O4wcqM3v7
Hey @SouthwestAir. guy in row 9. Flt #2015 saved seats. Why did I bother buying Early Bird seats for my kids if U can game the system??
@DeltaAssist this is the 2nd time I've shown up @ airport to check in. only to find that you have changed my seat. That's not okay.
@Delta @DeltaAssist every flight I've been on for the past 3 months have been delayed. almost missing my connection in a 2 hour layover.
Even with Pre✅ - had to strip because of non-informing staff at @united terminal C today. They'd rather be talking and not working.
@AmericanAir Rebooked 2x before 8:50am due to overbooking/tight connection. Very frustrating. No compensation offered like other airlines.
@SouthwestAir Do you have an ETA on the logging in issues
@JetBlue Wow. Bombshell.Loyal JB customer. Talked you up. NO more. You are UA. and AA in disguise now. So so sad. Why fly you now? no diff.
@AmericanAir Just had the worst customer service experience - AA agents refused to connect me to a manger. What is @AmericanAir coming to?
@DeltaAssist i've locked myself out of my account and the password reset page is broken so I'm not sure what to do?
@_Addi_Son_ @AmericanAir daaaaamn. Lost my business. #notimeforthat
@SouthwestAir very upset. Yesterday. flight delayed from 9:55pm to 11:45pm &amp; now a 6:30pm delayed to 7:55. Consideration for passengers?
@DeltaAssist Flight 370 2hrs late &amp; didn't get seats we paid for AND no refund! #neveragaindelta
@United 837 SFO-&gt;NRT now crossing 3.5 hours sitting at gate for repairs. Can we get a new plane please?!
@united We have another problem due to the LH strike. I sent you already a DM. Really hope you can help.
@united never going to fly with you again.  Stranded for 14+ hours. no hotel. not even united club passes.  #worstAirlineEver #ridiculous
@JetBlue u never tweet to me anymore!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
So getting @SouthwestAir wifi was a terrible decision. Slowest thing ever. can only really use Safari on my phone.
My @united flight is delayed because the emergency exit signs are not in #compliance. This one's an odd one. #avgeek #FAA
After maintenance was done. were waiting for a route and now the @united pilot timed out and we're waiting for a new one.
Flying with @United. Boarding done front to back. Last 15% forced to check carry-ons. How does air travel manage to always suck so much?
@united and another delayed flight.. I think this is 8 in a row... Consistency is important
@TedBigsby @AmericanAir Ugh...better switch my flights to Delta.
Hey @southwestair. Booked 2 tix for July 2015. Didnt receive an email. Charged my card. Wrote. but no response #WTF?
@DeltaAssist If I cancel a flight booked with PWM 24 within 24hrs. do the miles get refunded to my account?
Would never happen on @AlaskaAir! MT @JonRyan: Can't help but notice the Orioles menu looked better than ours today. http://t.co/HmkSxA5fpd
@AmericanAir Portland from Raleigh. North Carolina. Due to our first flight being delayed we were told that we would miss our connecting
@VirginAmerica I miss the #nerdbird in San Jose
Happy to be home but sure wish @AlaskaAir hadn't lost our luggage. Our kids are missing out on all of our cool treats we were bringing home.
legit 10 mins in the air and they said they had a problem and had to turn back ... What the actual fuck @JetBlue
@DeltaAssist on hold for an hour and a half to add a minor travel companion....
@DeltaAssist Hi. My daughter's BF is being denied boarding on flight 434 JFK-SFO -but he has a paid confirmation. Will miss a job interview.
Ok @united can I just get home now? We've been sitting at LGA for over an hour along with a 1hour 45min takeoff delay #ord #lga #yousuck
@emilyplu @SouthwestAir If they don't get a refund I'll never fly on @SouthwestAir.
Sad @united #fired flight attendants because of #potential #SAFETY reasons!   http://t.co/t1S10OgI1W
So @united is telling us our flight is delayed because of ONE missing piece of paper. #isntIt2014? #TMI #freedrinksplz @reallyhappening
.@SouthwestAir Both my flights were early. Yay! But then you lost my luggage. Boo! Please find it fast so my vacation isn't ruined.
Overbooked. moved to 1pm. delayed by mech issue. 1st officer missing. halfway through de-planing and we are back in our seats. @united FTW
Waiting on hold with @AmericanAir for 3.5 hours. I want to reschedule my flight for a URGENT medical appointment. Please help.
@SouthwestAir so flight 244 from PHX to SFO is delayed &amp; NOT 1 person says anything to any of us waiting in this C1 area. Rude very RUDE!!!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir yall service suck. Always having a problem when flying with yall and this new merger thing sucks
@AmericanAir status on AA4260 from ORD to EWR? Is it delayed to to winds at ORD or plane issue?
Flight on time.FREE wifi.snack&amp;drink. Clearly on @JetBlue. If it were @united I would still be in BOS delayed for 5hrs cuz they suck
@AmericanAir the flight was early-great- but checkin system isn't integrated with US Airways making the travel more stressful than necessary
big shout-out to @VirginAmerica for helping me get my lost ipad back!
Never flying @VirginAmerica ever again. Talk about rude service and multiple inconveniences.
MT @CNNMoney: Next time you fly @JetBlue. better get ready for bag fees and cramped seats http://t.co/mvqd6d5ytW
@DeltaAssist hey my flights currently delayed in southwest Florida airport on run way! If I miss my connecting flight what happens!
@AmericanAir American Airlines. why is my friend @JoshuaDMuir waiting 6 hours for assistance on your customer care line?
@united This is disgusting. You should ashamed of yourself. #Islamophobia #racism #NotMyAmerica
@Wolfiesmom @AmericanAir Sitting on the tarmac again what else is new
.@AmericanAir Yes. But a long wait for the correct belt to stop. a chat w the agent. then another search of all the other belts. V annoying!
Every @AmericanAir employee is either flat evil. an utter moron or both. Your shit company exists solely by government fiat.
@DeltaAssist another delay!! These last few weeks I’ve had the worst experience ever with your airlines. #SoDisrespectful
.@AmericanAir canceling our flight 924 from MDE "for the moment"? No info. no connections. no announcements... Stuck in a frustrating limbo
@AmericanAir you lost my luggage. your employees were rude and short. and I wasn't notified when my bags were found. http://t.co/cVnaAGZ2xv
@americanair. worst 1stclass. AA115. LAX to MIA at 1am on 3/7. Never offered water! Crew loud. rude huddled ... http://t.co/fnxx59iCKw
@SouthwestAir @flystl Terminal 2 empty. parking lot full! frequent occurrence! Why? Unacceptable!
@AmericanAir Can I please ask you to follow up on this? It is ludicrous for me to have to fill in additional paperwork to solve your problem
Why are we delayed on this very full @united flight?  The catering company failed to deliver galley carts?  Seriously??  #lifeontheroad
@SouthwestAir why do you cancel a flight to New Orleans due to weather when @AmericanAir is still flying out of DFW?  #neveragain
@ThatKevinSmith @NHLBlackhawks @VirginAmerica  Yes! Fuck the ducks
Just for future reference sometimes it is bad to share information like the captain is outside checking the tires @AmericanAir #yikes
@MelanieFiona @AmericanAir no honor among thieves.
This is not how I wanted to start my holidays. @united and @AmericanAir lost both of my bags. Why pay $60 if I wasn't going to get my bags?
Still waiting. Is this a joke?!  @united All I want is to change flight times. #helpmeunited Almost an hour on hold. http://t.co/X4AmIWTFbk
@AlaskaAir hey team. my bag got lost between you guys and TSA after I dropped it off at customs yesterday morning. Any help?
@Delta @DeltaAssist why is flight 2039 STILL on the tarmac in Atlanta AN HOUR after landing? how will you refund customers for their time?
Here's another for you @SouthwestAir extremely rude gate agent at DCA. Starting to #disappoint #alistpreferred 111457942
@AmericanAir is always screwing things up.
#Horrible service from @united premier line for my wife today as she's stuck at #PDX. She wishes she had flown @SouthwestAir
@united ua3919 stuck on the tarmac for more than 20mins now at Des Moines. Someone call DSM operations. Ridiculous! http://t.co/4p5mNPVt93
@DeltaAssist Boston to Atlanta 5:15. 10 upgrades and can't check the seats.   Sad service.
@united you really need to get your gate operations in order; Denver. O'Hare. you name it; what a mess and getting worse
To the bitch at @SouthwestAir who thought i was hiding something in my hair FUCK YOU THATS WHY YOURS WONT GROW BITCH .
@americanair i can take a delayed flight for some real shit but delays because you are to cheap to (cont) http://t.co/3lHYyV6WIv
@HoodieAllen @Delta @DeltaAssist whoa. I'm never flying delta again.
45 min and waiting on hold @SouthwestAir? Is there an alt #customerservice number to call? #southwestairlines
Hey @AmericanAir DFW we just landed from Austin. don't leave on flight 1284 to  KC without us!
Only @AmericanAir would cancel a flight 2 hours before and not notify it's passengers until they get to the airport😡
Shame on you @SouthwestAir. I hope you fired that flight attendant and do whatever you can for that woman.  https://t.co/h4dAFG0obi
Hey @SouthwestAir my friend is having an family emergency and is flying at 5:40 am. and has been hung up on twice while on hold. Please help
I can't believe how poorly I've been treated by @United after missing my connection because my flight got in late
@SleepintheGardn @united worst service ever. I was stranded in Chicago for a full day with no where to go bc of united
Worst counter service... Ever. @united always a bad experience flying with you.
I just want to pay for an upgrade@United. Your people suck as bad as your service.
@Delta and @AmericanAir WORST. My friend was in the ER couldn't fly to visit and u won't change flight w/o $500. @SouthwestAir is the BEST!!
@corb32 @USAirways HATE the US Air --@AmericanAir merger! US Air's snubbing of Army Ranger despicable! American honors military on flights!
@united you have lost someone's personal belongings. I am extremely concerned and upset. Was it stripped from the carousel by on of...
@AmericanAir https://t.co/pBJ5JFvALQ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦  your ears was waiting for this. have a full LISTEN!!!!u may not like r u want
@saragazarek @Delta @united yes that's actually never the problem
SO weird. Apparently @United auto checked me in - and dumped my seat? *sigh* I hate flying these days. Worst.
My @united flight to TX is delayed. So Iâ€™m playing with @hazelcast in a plane http://t.co/reEnc0X23Z
@AmericanAir . IFE not working. and seat didn't recline (4F) on flight #33 this morning from jfk to lax. 4k mile comp is unacceptable !
@united I'll stop tweeting when you actually respond to my complaint or DM. More than 50% of people that hear my story have 1 of their own.
@united ummm then you cancel the flight?? I have an emergency maternity doctor appt in the morning that my husband will now MISS. WTF.
Hello @SouthwestAir. you have a bad habit of cancelling flight 596 on Sun nights.  Please do not cancel it tonight.
@AmericanAir won't let us on with our guitars which is illegal. They are literally the worst.
Damn @AmericanAir. no wifi on a cross country flight!? What is this. 1985? 👎
I feel completely absolved over losing my mind at @united last year. They are literally so bad they make monks angry. http://t.co/JuiOLBFakZ
Hey @SouthwestAir keeping customers on hold for 50 minutes before 8am is really terrible customer service #pickupthephone
@united my dog is on flight UA3768 from IAD. stuck in Houston. no updates from customer service for 8 hours!! Is he okay?!??!?
@AmericanAir Always have old planes and mechanical issues on the flight from #mia to #eyw
@AmericanAir crew notified us when we left at 7am that the internet was not working. Mid flight we were notified about the power.
@LianaWW @united eventually. then. die to poor planning again. we are still waiting on a 2.5 hour line.
@SouthwestAir I didn't purchase. Was just the Alist login page not working. Just didn't use wifi today. Wanted to bring it to attention.
@united why did you cancel the 6:30am EWR-ATL today after boarding? Start caring that we are depending on you. #late
$39.95/mo for in-flight internet that is so slow I can send an email when I take off and beat it the the destination. @DeltaAssist @Gogo
@AmericanAir lies lies lies
.@AlaskaAir why? RT @mcauliflower: Say your sfo flight to pdx is late... Do you delay it again to load food onto it for 15 min? Alaska does.
@AmericanAir hello. I've sent several emails in regards to a refund with no response. What can I do to get through to someone.
@united  Bummed when I'm travelling with two young kids across country flight gets cancelled and rebooked 5 HOURS later.
@AmericanAir Rude gate agent MIA.would not check for other seats despite many vacancies. flight 710 to PHL at 2pm.Great customer service #AA
@united these maintenance issues are becoming too often. Take care of your planes so I can make it as planned.
@Heather_Poole @NYDailyNews @AmericanAir #newamerican #shameful
@united lost one of our bags again #smh #UpgradeOnOurReturnFlightPlease
UA4993 waiting on tarmac at ATL for one hour now waiting for gate. @united #hartsfieldblows
Hey @united Why is flight UA1458 on Monday NOVEMBER 2 (yes. 9 months from now) cancelled?  #customerservice #noanswer #whyevenofferit
@JetBlue I lost my wallet on a plane. how would I go about retrieving it? Pleas help
In OTHER airport news: No reason from @united as to why flight is delayed. It just ... is. I suspect collusion between them &amp; airport bars.
@tiffanyreisz The flights INTO NYC have been horrible. I'M LOOKING AT YOU. @JetBlue. @elisamarie @andrewtshaffer
@dataeditor @floodfish that's what i was thinking.  in this case. though. i was complaining about how slow @united's homepage is.
@YahooNews @SouthwestAir @JetBlue   Flying is now a total hassle. Jammed planes. cramped seats. long TSA lines. high prices. late runs. Bad.
GUILTY AS HELL MT @g_bluestone Hi @united. do u know the baggage center isn't taking calls? That's guilty as hell. Give me back my suitcase
Oh @JetBlue why hast thou forsaken us?? It was never about the cookies.  http://t.co/dK9HfWHDIx
Best ad for @USAirways ever: watching their prompt. smooth boarding process at the gate right next to our @JetBlue mess. #LateAgain
I remember the days when you could book a @SouthwestAir fight 6 weeks early and not have it cost $800. Fuel's cheap. Ridiculous ripoff.
@dallasshipp @united had the worst experience with me. I got stuck in Washington. D.C. Overnight by myself. I got a $100 voucher for my
Sike delayed even longer @united is the worst #neveragain
Why must @dfwairport always suck? #always #migraine @AmericanAir
@melchoyce @jetblue Really any music other than maybe Kesha piped into a phone line is horrible.
Frustrated w dealing with @AlaskaAir app and site - if I'm forced to switch carriers due to @Delta divorce they'd better up their game PDQ
@SouthwestAir this marks hour # 4 of flight delay due to AC outage and now there's no pilot available??
@AmericanAir been here since 1:00 and my flight to Dallas keeps delaying. what a disappointment. Sad to know I won't be making for dinner!!!
Rough first day back at the office after getting home at 5:00 am due to delays and lost baggage with my @united pals
2 hr delay because there's no pilot. Then we have to turn the plane around because they left a side panel open. Fuck you @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir WiFi. almost 2 hrs to get 1 email sent. not sure it was worth the $8 #disappointed  :(
@RFFL_Obscene @SouthwestAir is no longer known as a "low fares" airline.
@AmericanAir so over it! First my flight cancelled at last minute. now stuck on standby. AND none of the power outlets work in the terminal.
@AmericanAir You'd better talk to both your @USAirways flight atdnts and gate crew. Either they hate their passengers or pissed abt merger.
@united flight 420 to ROC boarded with no pilots and no A/C. If I did that to my dog in a car. I go to jail. UAL does it with no problem.
Charging a change fee that's double the amount of the originally purchased ticket is ridiculous. You all are better than that @DeltaAssist
@AmericanAir it is ridiculous that there is no wi-fi on this SFO-MIA flight. A relatively new plane. Really? Another let down.
Once again I didn't take @AlaskaAir and once again I'm stuck with a miserable delay on @DeltaAssist. @Delta. #WhenwillIlearn
And the airlines with the most cancelled and delayed flights goes to...drum roll please....@SouthwestAir #allthetime #idontgetit
Another 30min waiting on hold for @AmericanAir #Advantage to pick up the phone.  Does anyone work there anymore?  Odd way to do business.
@JetBlue Great customer service when you CHARGE a cancellation fee on top of not refunding a ticket #badservice #greedy #Airlines #travel
Here we go again with some @united bullshit...flight delayed 2 hours
@AmericanAir Howdy!  Stuck on plane for an hour now. and concerned we'll miss Flight 2209 to OC.  Any chance its takeoff will be delayed??
@united - No response to DM. so... Called Baggage Claim. Bag IS in SYR. Rude rep "It will get there IF and when it gets there" Gr8 cust serv
@AmericanAir fails yet again. #2HourDelay for no apparent reason. cust serv reps are #incompetent. This is why I will always fly @JetBlue
@DeltaAssist Why can't the IFE be enabled when sitting on the ground in ATL for a weather delay? DL2430 http://t.co/YcqYmrxDPJ
@deltaassist but there was no need to rush because now we're delayed at JFK waiting for 1st the flight crew and now the CAPTAIN.
delays on delays for @united 4890 - missing rehearsal and damn angry about it
@united the worse and most unprofessional .pre-screening crew at DXB ! Way to go! And u wonder why emirates airline is beating you.
Hey @AmericanAir: sitting on AA107 20 minutes after landing at JFK and door still not open. Couldn't you at least explain the problem to us?
@JetBlue WOW! THIS AIRLINE OFFICIALLY SUX!!! THEY CANCELED MY FLIGHT AND NO FLIGHTS UNTIL TOM!!
Hey @United - the lounge situation at LAX is unacceptable. I'm in the former F lounge because the big lounge closed at 8! Not a seat here!
never again @SouthwestAir. never again. why is a later flight to chicago getting out before mine.
@DeltaAssist  Missed my flight to Miami this morning because Delta chose to have the Bhm to Atlanta flight sit on the Tarmac for 30 minutes.
@united #globalservice member fly 500.000 miles no access to the lounge at LAX #badform #staralliancegold means nothing #WakeUpNow #United
Really @DeltaAssist - a two hour wait time on the phone this morning? Two Hours!!!
@sampottorff @AmericanAir @GOLDENthe24k @EdwardZo poor grammar bud ;) but this is disgusting
@RonCharles Holy hell. Did your wife's head explode?  (Yet another example of how bad @united sucks.)
@megumixbear @AmericanAir Using that airline is the problem in the first place. :\
@vinnieFM @FrontierCare @SouthwestAir I never don't feel that way! At least we go home the day we left.
.@AmericanAir is the only site i have seen where you need your passport info to just check in online. That's terrible.
@united Stuck in DC ... Yet again. I misconnected due to an airline mistake and because of misinformation. about to miss my flight again.
Worst traveling experience ever. I will never fly @SouthwestAir again.
@DeltaAssist I check in a day in advance. have a physical boarding pass. get to the gate &amp; I'm told I'm not checked in &amp; can't board? #rude
@Delta @VirginAmerica Surprise trip totally ruined so thanks Virgin and thanks Delta. much appreciated!!! #zerocustomerservice
@AmericanAir where are my bags? Topped off the worst trip I've ever had with AA. Not in the mood for another 3 hour hold.
@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
Irritated @AmericanAir on the seat fee. Play games by not assigning me a seat on the hopes I pay more!  Should have booked virgin saved $
So now we're indefinitely stuck at @SAVHHIairport. This is after weather diversion from ATL 5 hours ago. Please send new crew @DeltaAssist!
@united you're the worst airline ever.
@united ewr to sfo- broken tray. and old plane! http://t.co/vshQXIpE0l
@wycats specifically what I've seen is that @United doesn't allocate enough extra planes to prevent a delay from rippling everywhere.
@DeltaAssist yesterday you said you would be better in future. but still no response to my question! Clearly not better. #custservfailure
@united SCAM. They charged for seat upgrade and then version plane and shoved me to the back stealing from customers. SAD
Hey @AmericanAir you guys lost my luggage on Sunday. I've been told 4 different things by your reps about where it is. For real where is it?
DFW to MAD - A/C. bathrooms. TV's. wing flaps. brakes. emergency crews. Diverted to ORD. hotel w/no shuttle. Disappointed @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir extremely disappointed in your customer service. Missed a Hanukkah get together/ family reunion b/c of 3hr 'mechanical delays'
@SouthwestAir if you're going to keep me on hold for 1 hr &amp; 38 min. please get better hold music!&amp; please pick up! Need to get back to nyc!
LAX. I hate you. @americanair. you should be ashamed for having only one agent open. You guys get worse each flight.
@AmericanAir Spoiled from flying Southwest. AAFlt 1318 boards late then decides we need more fuel. What a bunch of clowns.
@groditi @VirginAmerica ugh. VA was once much better than this
Flew from LA-New Jersey-Lisbon- Madrid. Missing bag and musical gear. @united and @taportugal  have no clue where it is as of now!!?
@AmericanAir I had the worst travel experience ever! My bag was lost and I had to purchase all new clothes for a graduation smh
@DeltaAssist I was on the DL295 earlier today which was delayed. Counter staff told me new flight is 8am but w
T-3 hours and counting. Take me home @SouthwestAir! Cuteness is waiting. #ilovemyfamily
@anvilwalrusden @united I guess I will stop complaining about my two hour delay and missed connection in Dallas..
Way to go @united!  You lost the same car seat coming and going. Please don't make me deal with off-shoe non-English speakers.
@JetBlue why are you destroying the JetBlue Experience? You built an airline on comfortable planes and fewer fees... http://t.co/nfocOOZDGV
Will never fly @AmericanAir and hopefully no one else does either..horrible horrible experience #southwestAir @SouthwestAir is the way to go
@jacksonfall which begs the question: What's worse than air travel with @united  (Answer: Nothing.)
We were on the phone with so many people from @united and no one could process a payment. This level of inefficiency is unacceptable!
@united First image where #UnitedAirlines made us late a whole day by turning around our plane after flying 2
@americanair FIND MY BAG! Worst trip on airline ever! Forgot to hire pilot. then Baggage scanner not working. DRO to DFW Flight 3136!!!
@bigalwood @AmericanAir the entire industry is crap...its dollars vs gain..there is no customer service
@_rakeshjain @TarekFatah @united   It's worse airline. I traveled once from Melbourne Australia to LA. That was worse experience I ever had
Last retweet shares more horror stories about @united very in line with my recent experiences. I'm so tired of broken airline industry.
Unhappy with @AmericanAir Can't choose a seat therefore can't check into my flight for tomorrow. 😒 #AmericanAirlines #fail
.@AmericanAir. you screwed me over back in July &amp; today you cancelled my Wife's flight. She's stuck in Cedar Rapids. This is unacceptable!
If @AmericanAir could not hang up on me after 8 hours of being on hold that would be greaaaat.
Shame on you @united......Shame on you.  Glad I booked with another airline.
@Expedia @united v disappointed-booked flights 60 days out-want to change date-$400 fee. #United rep hung up on me! #planschange #notcool
@Delta @DeltaAssist doesn't seem to pay attention to customer's concerns. Is dis wat delta calls customer service? Sheer disappointment :(:(
Wow! @VirginAmerica officially worst mobile app in the sky. Saves nothing - not even your virgin FF#  circa 2005.
@JeromeASF @united I think the moral of the story is TO NEVER FLY WITH UNITED AGAIN!
I bought a @Finnair ticket but just found out I'm flying on an @AmericanAir plane. so now I understand how badly it hurts to get catfished.
@nomadicmatt If you think those are terrible check out the Eisenhower era 757s that @americanair flies. Makes my fleet look world class++
Man I can't believe my TV wasn't working on my @VirginAmerica flight yesterday. I was pretty disappointed
@united I ant believe that this year all three of my flights with this airline has been delayed. cancel or you just sit
The woman next to me on this plane appears clean &amp; well-groomed with perfect make-up and clothes. However. she smells like BO. @JetBlue
Stuck on our plane for an hour and going to miss my connecting flight... So Feliz Navidone @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir 50 minutes on hold is a bit too much don't ya think?
@The3GuysRant @MyCondomClub Ya that's horrible @SouthwestAir @JetBlue @flyLAXairport
@ClaraHughes_ @united  my husband had a terrible time with United at O'Hare too. Booo! @truenorth74
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica oh that's not good.
Will NEVER fly @AmericanAir again! MCO airport staff &amp; service yesterday was ATROCIOUS and beyond rude. Save yourself the trouble!!!
Disappointed in the rude. demeaning attitude from AirServ &amp; @united at @iah during the storms tonight. We're all in this together.
@united  3 hours+ stuck on runway in Cancun. 90+ degrees and people are baking. Crew A+ but kids/elderly should not be in these conditions.
@iamwill @united fool me once shame on you. fool me twice......... 🙊
Itâ€™s not too late! #FinDDYourMatch for your chance to win great prizes. like a @JetBlue trip! 18+NoPurchNec http://t.co/t2Lz7lI4kQ
"@kylekinane: Haven't gotten laid in a while? Fly @united. They'll totally fuck you." @laurakbrand looks like united is still killing it
I have switched flights 3 times in 40 minutes. @JetBlue - love you girl. Let's do this. We can do this. Hope. I live in a place called Hope.
My @united flight is 45 minutes late taking off: the pilot claims they "don't have a baggage count." BS? Or incompetence?
@SouthwestAir trying to book Nov 8-16 alb to MCO. Prices keep going up. Wait or book now??  #frustrated #expensive
@JetBlue next time you lose someone's bag and ruin their vacation. might want to have your CS act like they actually care!
Since I am finally back to SJ after a 12 hours of delays and lies. I can now begin my slander campaign on @united #StayTuned #FuckUnited
@virginamerica lost a wallet on flight 35 into JFK this morning. and we are stuck in a kafkaesque nightmare were no one knows lost and found
@Delta @DeltaAssist any news on the new crew for DL4020? waiting for them for 2 hours now on the plane. Please help me get home to my girls!
@AmericanAir customer relations have so many people complaining that I have been on hold for an hour already...
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir I'd be kicking out windows and hiking by now!
I literally cannot remember the last time I flew a non-delayed @united flight. My own fault. kept falling 4 the cheap tix. #neveragain

@DeltaAssist the CS solution I received from Gold Support was to return back to the airport to resolve the voucher issue _ at 2AM?
@SouthwestAir I need information on a "cancelled" flight but the customer service line is busy... HELP!
Stuck in a middle seat and the guy in the aisle doesn't show!! 🙌 thank you @VirginAmerica gods!! #happybug!
Reminded why I never fly @AmericanAir worst experience ever. #rude I miss @JetBlue and @SouthwestAir

Hey @united approaching an hour wait from gate to bag carousel due to understaffed ground crew? Were@you expecting a slower day?
Never flying @united again! #worstairlineever
@susan_margarita @JetBlue Yup. that's EXACTLY what happened. Ended up booking with @AmericanAir. Wasted so much time trying to book.
@SouthwestAir this is by far the worst Customer service situation I have experienced with your airline. That's why I choose swa normally
@ChaleyRose @AmericanAir oh no  I hope you get it back ... We Miss you on @Nashville_ABC
@DeltaAssist - thx-I was told that my bag wouldn't fit under my seat(it does) short 4 time. I'll need to wait for my checked bag-so annoyed.
@DeltaAssist re-think #KLM partnership. after total mess up w/ seats on flight to FRA- 36 hours later still no luggage!!
@TaheraHAhmad I can't wait for @united to start flying in Australia just so I can boycott them! #unitedfortahera
@AmericanAir  why can't I speak to anyone at AA. I've been on hold for 5 hours now.
@AmericanAir you always make my day with your delays and your fault of responsibility to your customers...
@united wish someone would care that I just missed my second flight because the plane sat on the taxi for over an hour. Some vacation start.
@AmericanAir flight delayed.  been sitting in plane for over 45 min and have not been offered a drink yet in 1st class.  Why I fly @Delta

Thanks @jetblue for the even more dirt on my even more space seat #gross #fail http://t.co/NMdemlhUAV
.@jetblue my flight from Boston to Ft. Lauderdale is cancelled and I need to make a connection to Peru at 5pm. Can you help?
@united #flight1730 Why are my bags not here waiting for me? It's almost 11pm in Phoenix and I'm waiting for my bags! Ridiculous!
@AmericanAir My flight from DFW to Pit was 2.5 hours.  I've already waited longer in the cancellation line. Why won't you fix this?
@united So much for "priority" check-in/boarding - @SeaTacAirport waiting for the past 30 min in the "int'l svc" line w 1 personnel. #fail
On a half empty flight to JFK via @JetBlue with a plethora of "premium seats" available but no upgrades. Bad business or standard protocol?
Ok @AmericanAir. FLT 1495 delays have been excessive today #fail #frustrated
Ugh. @SouthwestAir lost my bag with my cars in it. ðŸ˜­
@camerondallas @AmericanAir Poor cam :( ease help him @AmericanAir
Are you kidding me @united? Flt 1236 is 6 hours with no tv power wifi music entertainment? What is this. 1965? I hope there's food ...
@VirginAmerica not cool to have us get on plane and then sit on runway for 1hr. Should have known before we boarded. http://t.co/V3dwGUvxuN
@Lg4Lg @united leaving a poor caged animal in the rain! every worker witnessing this should be fired immediately! http://t.co/jXR3r1wzNo
So @AmericanAir broke a wheel off brand new luggage and won't accept any responsibility because wheels aren't covered. #fail
Still waiting for @United to reimburse me. Pending charge has not fallen off. #releasecode
Never flying @AmericanAir again. This is the worst flying experience I've ever had.
@SouthwestAir Waited on hold &gt;15 w/ customer service :( What time do I need to arrive @ DTW for a 0555 flight?
@Delta ripped my checked bag on my way to vacation. Now it's impossible to pack it to get home. @DeltaAssist #nothappy
@ThatsAdmirable @AmericanAir I only travel where southwest flies. Too many bad experiences with AA
@alaskaair those guys at @DeltaAssist won't put in my Alaska FF number. So irritating...
@AlaskaAir flight 356. Shows boarding now... No plane even there. Let alone unloading from arriving flight... Why not show flight delayed
@SouthwestAir what the heck is going on? Mean flight attendants and still can't find my friend's luggage?!? #highlydisappointed
@SouthwestAir worst airline in the world! How do you cancel a flight 15mins before take off. Islip is closed but JFK and LGA aren't...
From unwilling to book me on a rival airline to putting me up in a bug infested hotel @AmericanAir has caused me to miss my moving day. Fail
@petedavidson @united United are terrible. I stopped flying with them years ago.
@DeltaAssist Maybe you guys can help find the missing flight attendant for Flight 2929 at JFK.
Waiting to board @SouthwestAir flight to #SanDiego for #SMMW15. Joining @KristinMestre to represent #SAP. http://t.co/Sz95qGorEV
@AmericanAir email was sent last Thursday still no response. If nothing by Wednesday I'm filing a public complaint with the FAA.
@AmericanAir My phone officially died while on hold waiting for help. Plugged back in and approaching the hour mark now of no service...
@SouthwestAir appalled at rude/horrible service from RICO just now in your customer service center.I just lost my dog &amp;a close friend. #SOS
@DeltaAssist DL1454 spent almost 2 hrs on hot plane waiting on late crew &amp; mech problems &amp; no air. now waiting on DL101- awful experience
@united stranded in Newark after a cancellation yesterday + then delay which led to missed connection tonight. Hotel voucher for the night?
@DeltaAssist waiting for bags from flight #410 for 2 hours.You think someone would let passengers know the bags were sent to wrong terminal.
@AmericanAir Just the whole thing from start to finish has been awful! Will DM now.
Hmm I'm in Colombia...luggage in Miami. I have the worst luck! At least @AmericanAir knows where it is!
@Delta @DeltaAssist can you guys explain that while I thought I would board now. I just got a 2 hr delay. Two hours as we should be boarding
Constantly 100% disappointed by @SouthwestAir. Will be canceling card and rapid rewards as soon as I get home.
@colbyjansenXXX @united You've got to be kidding me. Never replies - but replies to THIS?!
@united kinda feel like the $6.99 you charge for in flight Wi-Fi is ridiculous. AND it sucks. slow. or doesn't work. #anythingtomakeabuck
@united yes. flight showed as good- my missing codeshare seat on it mysteriously reappeared 24h before. united app glitch? could be.
"This phone call may be recorded" never seems to be recorded when I need it! $800 about to be lost @SouthwestAir I am done!
@SouthwestAir how you gonna cancel my flight but run flights at the exact same time? Cmon fam
It was inevitable.... my @united flight from Denver to Eugene is now 3 HOURS DELAYED! ugh!!
Hey @united how are you gonna cancel my flight? Now i gotta cancel my rental car. condo rental. and my vacation time for work!!!!
@JetBlue it's not cool that you only have seat selection if you are paying extra for a premium seat. #unhappycustomer
@SouthwestAir not gonna lie. I am really getting used to the onboard power plugs offered by @Delta. step up your game!
@DeltaAssist honestly. really disappointed in how 3711 is being handled.
@AmericanAir u.s. air backed up ticketing. and then told the 20 people who missed the flight that we should have gotten their sooner.
@markbland -Maybe @sprint is a sister company w/ @AmericanAir. ..a partnership in shitty customer service &amp; business practices.
@united after this treatment I am NEVER sitting on one of your flights. You PR after this is going to crash and burn http://t.co/kou64eqtNJ
@Alancumming @VirginAmerica Please continue making Mr. Cumming suffer. I enjoy seeing him all riled up. Love. xo
@united please tell flight 3466 from ORD-BTV to wait for me!! Delayed a bit on flight 333 Austin to ORD.
That look when @SouthwestAir get played and told to turn around and you miss your connection http://t.co/hPpOteN0p1
.@united you guys massively suck. First you make me check my tripod. then damage it &amp; the bag I put it in and now I have to throw both out.
@united your wifi was horrible. your staff knows it and your refund site doesn't load.  Why do you make things so hard????
Week started w/ 1.5hr phone hold with @SouthwestAir &amp; is ending with a 4 hour delay with @SouthwestAir - can't even blame the polar vortex!
Never flying @united again - horrible customer service and god awful gate attendant. Id rather walk back to Tampa at this rate
@SouthwestAir suck at Hobby Airport!!!! Worst experience ever
@DeltaAssist Looks like we're just waiting on either a fixed plane or a new plane &amp; can't have the latter unless we don't have the former.
I'd like to say that @USAirways  @AmericanAir has the WORST customer service of all time. All time worst experience I have ever had.
@united all no no no and no ho ho ho @ LHR today UA929 home for xmas disappointed bad service #flyBA loyal once... http://t.co/YyFBoBmS8c
Exceptionally disappointed in @united who have let me down! Busted bags. messed around flights and all I get is a feedback form. #awful
@united for the third flight/week in a row delayed and then sit and wait for a gate. I have zero faith in flying with you. Get it together.
@DeltaAssist please follow me so I can dm a problem I have
@AmericanAir I wrote a complaint about a flight from NYC to Manchester last Monday on the website and have heard nothing. Customer service?!
@united SHAME ON YOU
@united Everyone has an autistic child in their family. I will never fly you again. #BoycottUnitedAirlines
@DeltaAssist bummed to see that you spilt my family up after YOU changed planes. Called 4 help &amp; got no where #notcool
@AmericanAir there were items ripped open from one of my bags and missing that I checked. can someone call me immediately
Not going to lie I literally fly @JetBlue for the tv and satellite radio. and they aren't working today for my almost 3hr flight??? #really
@SydneyScreams4u @AmericanAir Holyshit they suck up the ying yang lol
@DeltaAssist why is 4610 delayed 4 hours due to weather and 4560. scheduled to depart *later* is on time?
@AmericanAir On hold 3+ hours re: flight I'm checked in for leaving in hour but whose DFW connection is canceled. How to reach you?
@CMPunk My boyfriend's luggage is lost every time he flies @AmericanAir. Every. time. Our airport has 5 gates and they can't get it to 1.
@AmericanAir your tech support hung up on me because someone transferred me her. the wrong person... So rude.
â€œ@bankslucas: If my mom has said she hates @AmericanAir once today. she's said it 1.000 times âœˆï¸ðŸ™…â€ !!!!!!!!!!!
I know that airlines reconfigure rows / adjust distance between seats. That's fine. I've just never seen a row this out of whack. @AlaskaAir
@united any resolution to my issue with the gift card exchange website?
@VirginAmerica my cousin. Meagan Leahy. lost her wallet (..it was stolen); She's on flight 358 (SFO-BOS) tonight. treat her well? Champagne?
New tagline: @united we wait together for over an hour for our bags. http://t.co/razspb2xLS
#UA3892 @united crew shows up at the airport 1hr past the flight's departure time. yet they walk so slow you'd think they're 1hr early...
Lost bag. delayed bag. call at 1am. lost bag again ... Seriously @AmericanAir you are the worst!
This is the second time @SouthwestAir has lost my luggage. Think I'll take American next time. and every time. Unbelievable.
@JacquelineeLim @SouthwestAir they lost my sisters bag with all her clothes in them yesterday ðŸ™…
Worst flight leg ever!!! @united airlines had an absolute shocker tonight!! #venting
Fuck @SouthwestAir
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem. mechanics trying to "fix" the problem. safety first. better to change the plane
@united are you going to an issue an apology to the racism and discrimination a passenger had received by one of your attendants ?
@DeltaNewsroom is it ok to keep customers in an constant state of delay? @united it's ok for me to get in past 12? http://t.co/Whk2yktym3
@AlaskaAir MVP Gold no longer boards with First.....sigh
No WiFi on a plane? What is this 2010? Come on @jetblue you can do better
1 hr flt outlets work @AmericanAir - 3.5 hr flight they don't. Attendant says bad luck. Bad luck is when all employees go to @VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir Flt #cancelled again for another mechanical issue.  Lost my #FirstClass seat again. Cant remember last time I arrived on time
@SouthwestAir my flight cancelled. Trying to rebook and have been on hold for 40 minutes. #frustration

Once again -&gt; @AmericanAir worst service ever! 😠
@itsAbbeyyy guess what....@united is delayed. Surprise surprise. Never on time
What's the deal with 927 out of EWR @JetBlue? How come when I change my flight time it costs me $150? Now I'm stuck in a middle seat.
No wifi. screens. or outlets. Sitting in Economy Minus on an overbooked plane. Must be a @united flight!
@Itsukine I would be SO angry! @DoryuuShepherd @ShishaSheppy @Arcothewolf @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir tag #airplanetruthbombs if you leave a note!
What is cause of 90 minute delay on @SouthwestAir flight 1910 from BOS to BWI? Plane is at gate in BOS. no weather in MD yet.
@SouthwestAir Trying to book and international flight and getting error to re-enter my RR#. Called and have been on hold for an hour. Ugh...
@AmericanAir bag STILL lost with South Pole gear. approaching 2 mo. I speak to CEOs around the world who travel. Let's find it!
@AmericanAir in case if you guys don't know. you have the worst services in the commercial airline industry! Sincerely
@AmericanAir: ZERO customer service. Cancelled a trip April 2014 (grandfather died suddenly). I lose $2300 because voucher expires March 17?
@united you should be ashamed of yourself and whoever was responsible should be fired!  http://t.co/0RWBh6jx2i
@SouthwestAir Hi. sorry to bother u but have been on the phone w/ southwest for last 2 hours and still stuck. Could u help please?

@united providing stellar non-communication as usual at LIT - trying to get out to ORD late as usual due to maintenance 😕
@Jennkorbin @united their staff should be left on the Tarmac for however long the dog was. Ugh
Hey @USAirways or @AmericanAir. Who even cares. Delayed flight for 4 hrs and counting. and we can't get a single update from anyone.
@united my water broke and my brother cannot get on his flight from NWK 2 BTV. Who will take me to the hospital now. united?!
@DeltaAssist Ur website says my delayed bag claim was closed @ 6:30 pm PST yesterday. It's 9:45 AM &amp; still "awaiting assignment to driver"??
@AmericanAir disappointed with check in Dublin. Family of 3 not put together? Wasn't told or asked- communication key in customer service. 😖
@SouthwestAir I want me $8 back.  Your wifi sucks.
@United @Orbitz Shame on both of you! #bigcorpbully
I hate you @united. Crew is taking their time showing up and I will now miss my connection in FLL. And the SFO attendant was poor.
Bumped from one flight to another by @VirginAmerica. but handed completely professionally. Guess I get DC sunshine for a bit longer.
Hey. @united. I sign up for frequent flyer program and 2 flights in 2 weeks are both cancelled.  What's the scoop? #Grounded

got the dreaded package today from @united "congratulating" me for achieving Gold. Now I'm just lookin at this packet like it stinks.
Well we have 5 total flights from BOI to YVR and back. The first 3 have been delayed by @AlaskaAir hope the next two are better #cardholder
Shout out to @SouthwestAir for delaying my flight for 1 hour and counting AFTER we all got on the plane 😡
.@AmericanAir AA 3674 switched gates but no email notification. screen @ old gate doesn't indicate change. Also has wrong boarding time. F-
@JetBlue scariest take off ever. Flight 915 to SFO. I've never been so scared before. Thank God for free wifi.
@united  At least on my return. the flight (UA 28) was canceled and I'm about 7 1/2 hours late getting to EWR. It has really been swell.
@SouthwestAir @terrellowens @AmericanAir American is by far the worst company besides spirit!
@AmericanAir Delayed return flight already this morning. Remember me? #wheelsdown
My @AmericanAir flight was delayed and the connection missed so where do they put me up? Cigarette smoke filled filth http://t.co/LuZHaZXa6q
Woke up to a flight delay notice. My plane is the ONLY one delayed &amp; now my 2hr layover has become 30 min w/ a plane change 😒@SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir  don't know what's worse - this redonk 2 hour delay or the Wings muzak at your gate.  downright #kafkaesque
I have spent two days on the phone with @united trying to track down the GATE CHECKED bag they lost during an hour long flight. Oof.
@AmericanAir Hu stuck on flight 1638 from Charlotte. . NC to NY. Electric flu maintenance delay . What is normal protocol  ?
@SouthwestAir I am so mad that you're dropping the non-stop flight from LGA-CAK! This is the only nonstop from NYC to that area. Bye forever
Every single flight I've been on in the last few months with @SouthwestAir has been delayed. Used to be my fav airline but slowly changing 😭
@DeltaAssist can you confirm my medallion upgrade? I've been on hold for an hour!
@metsfan @SouthwestAir Ya. I had problems with Jen's flight that got rerouted to SLC for gas top off doing that too.
Shoutout @SouthwestAir ...missed my flight this morning. they got me on another flight with ease. and without having to pay
@DeltaAssist Why do you cancel flights after I get to the airport?!
@jetblue being so rude to a poor puppy in ft. Lauderdale :(
@DeltaAssist DL3722 - got a call. flt delayed until 7:55. got another call (at 6:55) that it was leaving at 7:10. Why make me fly @JetBlue?
Not cool @JetBlue "You're Not Going To Be Like The Big Change Coming To JetBlue" http://t.co/mXKsOZ17lt via @HuffPostTravel #JetBlueFail
@CowboyPharmD @united the last 5 flights I've booked through @united have been cancelled or delayed. worst company ever
Never flying @jetblue again. Spent hr looking for a bag they told me was at bclaim when it was really in the OH bin #travelfail #flyvirgin
@AlaskaAir Are you aware of any checkin issues via iOS app or via the web?  Have been attempting to checkin for my flight for the past hour.
@natbynature @americanair so sad
@optich3cz @AmericanAir @OpTic_FormaL @Delta @united I was delayed 8 hours flying back to the uk. will not be bookong them this year...
@united Just seeing this photo. Blame game on PetSafe? Please United. I have traveled the world and with Dogs and cats never heard such????
@AmericanAir 6 hour delayed flight AA94 to Madrid with no tvs? @united wouldn't play me like that :( @mktooley @runway4 #baitandswitch
@AmericanAir I've now been on hold for 2:27. longer than combined flight time from ABI to MSY. Is there another/easier way to get a refund?
All my jewelry stolen from my luggage and. as always. no help from @AmericanAir
Stressing! Read bad reviews of @AmericanAir for @British_Airways direct from Manchester to NYC. Should have gone via @HeathrowAirport #error
How do you have a crew delay at JLN @AmericanAir? There's one gate.. One plane. No transfers. See you soon @SouthwestAir!
Flying with @united is like dating a girl who is always late and doesn't really care about your plan. Be expecting the unexpected.
Hey @AmericanAir flt 1046 is late leaving KC. Please hold flt 1117 to Cabo for the 50+ passsengers on this flight!! #nomoreflightstocabo
@MoreAndAgain @JetBlue   Your name is Cocky McSwagsalot. Novody give a fuck about what you have to say.
@JetBlue any update on flight 917? Have been sitting on tarmac for over an hour despite no weather restrictions. Disappointing.
@Gerry_Corcoran @united @AmericanAir you're just killing these travels my man!
Thanks to Long Island traffic. I missed my @JetBlue flight. Let's hope I can get on the next flight to LAX so I don't miss any interviews!
@united at XNA won't say when flight to ORD will leave and ensures no one gets served fast enough to make last alternative out.
Yes. @united has known for hours the incoming plane is 43 minutes late. but waited until just before boarding to say we will be delayed.
@SouthwestAir Why the need for me to change my password to login to in-flight Wi-Fi? I like my password #frustrating #workedlastweek
@jnobleband @AmericanAir Just awful justification for such a drastic change.  Shame on you AA.
@ShivaShafii better be careful @united will kick you off the flight for questioning them
Somehow @united has managed to lose all 3 of my mother's bags. She's in Nigeria with no change of clothes. The baggage service team is AWFUL
.@ArnieK. yup. never been treated so poorly as a customer with @AmericanAir &amp; @USAirways. Actively moving over to @Delta &amp; @SouthwestAir.
@AmericanAir flight attendants you're RUDE! -s
Canceling flights before there is 1 mm on snow on the ground?  Thats' @AmericanAir - easier for them. inconvenient for travelers.
@united yes I did.  They changed the location and never informed anyone.
.@united flight canceled. no meal vouchers. no hotel help. no flights to Maine until tomorrow afternoon. Anything #vegetarian at #ewr?
Worst flight ever @DeltaAssist. DL 702. 4 hour delay then rerouted to ATL with a 3.5 hour layover before leaving to MSP.
@JetBlue Thanks for delaying my flight to ny about 6 h!!!
@AmericanAir 1561 landed over 50 min ago and still no bags.  WTF
@SouthwestAir when you re-routed me to MDW. it disconnected me from my group  &amp; has me getting to MBJ hours later so I will miss my ride
@aabida_allaham @JetBlue and it was well deserved. Could you imagine being on the Jet Blue flight. Shame on #caribbeanairlines
@Delta @DeltaAssist How is it okay that I buy a direct flight. but when YOU cancel. I'm rebooked on a 2 stop itinerary?  @JetBlue got my biz
@Delta @DeltaAssist something should be done about the delays on flight 208 out of jfk sodas and snacks ain't enough been delayed 4 times ðŸ˜¤
I used to love JetBlue back in the day. Now they are ruined and I will not fly them again. @JetBlue . Here's why. http://t.co/MMc0vwADiD
@omarciusmelhem @AmericanAir I was at the same flight. I arrived at Rio today morning. AA never more!
Flight #2341 landed at DFW nearly an hour ago and no bags have come through baggage claim.... @AmericanAir
At the airport for 2 hours and waiting another 2 hours for a delayed flight compelled me to write my first tweet. I hate you @SouthwestAir
@united My first tweet. I need to say this. United Airlines treated us horribly. and then never responded after we wrote a detailed letter
@united Flights cancelled 4 times. 15+ hour layovers. change of flight w/o any heads up.....#dontflyunited #hatethisairline
@americanair Supervisor David just hung up on me while I was trying to get info on the flight for my grandmother's funeral. #fail #RUDE
@directtv fail on @united http://t.co/R8byL6MWQ0
Screw You Jet Blue @JetBlue 👎 #BoycottJetBlue
@DeltaAssist I don't have the receipt numbers. I paid online prior to my flight both times. and never received anything via email.
@DeltaAssist @Delta 20 minute wait in the sky priority security line at MSP airport. This is crazy.
Anybody surprised? @United #sucks the most according to Twitter users (while @VirginAmerica is the most #awesome)  http://t.co/AIzNd9TSUH
Alright @SouthwestAir ! May my connecting flight in Atlanta truly wait for me through all this delay! #WinterTravelAdvisory
@ReIntonation @Chuggernaut6 @united &lt;= worst airline in the US
Will just take 2 years longer than promised @chicagotribune: United Airlines adding Wi-Fi to regional jets. @united
On my first flight since @united was so awful on my trip from VA. Taking @AmericanAir to NYC.
Okay. There's my @united plane. Can we leave now :) http://t.co/ME4SbfjzXo
Hey @united... When you got rid of the SkyWest ground crew at Denver. you really could have used a backup plan. This is getting ridiculous.
Just had the worst experience with @JetBlue They turned my husband away at the gate with his boarding pass in hand! Get it together!
@chevd80 When I called @AmericanAir w/a problem their custserv rep hung up on me. (They apologized on Twitter later.)
Bunch of clowns working this flight. All they're missing are the noses. So annoyed. @AmericanAir
@Gawker shame on @SouthwestAir for not making a 911 call. # reprehensible
so if @united could just get this plane boarded. maybe we could. like. i don't know. LEAVE EVENTUALLY. #delayedflight #gongshow
@JetBlue &amp; @SouthwestAir are to blame for ruining air travel they have turned airplanes into Greyhounds buses with wings FFS
@JetBlue You just broke my heart. I thought you were different. #RemeberThePigeon http://t.co/63CWp8ahla #SadDayForTravel
@united coming on 3 hour Tarmac delay @FAANews ?
7 hr flight &amp; @jetblue lets us know as we're boarding no tv. Maybe a heads up so we can grab a magazine next time #ScrewYouCustomers
So disappointed with @AmericanAir - my luggage looked like it came from a battleground :(
@DeltaAssist no make my plane leave on time.
@united yes! Flights delayed both internal and international and no clear explanation as to what's going on #getmehome
"@ColleenB123: I have the worst luck with airlines. @AmericanAir lost my luggage. Someone Help! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"

1/ Applied for an @united card with @chase yesterday and never ever during the phone conversation did they ask how they could help me...
#BotcottJetBlue @JetBlue I'm so happy right now that I will never have to fly with JetBlue! Love @MatthewLush
What's up with all the future @VirginAmerica flights being delayed?
Seriously @DeltaAssist and @Delta. flight attendants on DL2728 just go camp out in seats at back of airplane during 30 minute ground delay?
not surprised that @JetBlue has continued their streak of rudeness and unprofessionalism
@hayley_bosworth THE WORST @united
Hi @united so for some reason you didn't put my bags on my flight to Costa Rica. Now I have no clothes. Can you please help? This stinks
@DeltaAssist Linsday from Cincinatti incredibly rude about it. and she is a supervisor.
@AmericanAir Help me out this please. help me understand how am I supposed to use this voucher http://t.co/XqcMvHcXUT #fail
@DeltaAssist wouldn't hold plane but now we are still waiting at gate with no air or offer of water. Flight 1700
Unable to obtain a refund for over a month for a cancelled flight! @americanair customer relations &amp; refunds keep sending me back and forth!
Dad: Delta Charged Me $88 Fee to Sit Next to 4-Year-Old Daughter http://t.co/7xMVXfH00h. @Delta @DeltaAssist. You really blew it! #Shame
@united that is SO passing the buck on your negligence! @theregoesbabs pic is from YOUR airline.Own up to it. So sad FOR you and the dog.

@AmericanAir I've had to switch planes twice today. I just want to get home(supposed to land at 4) and have sushi. Worst birthday gift ever
@PlsFeedTheBear wishing I could do something about this... Unfortunately. I can't... But yeah... Two more customers lost to @united forever
1: Do NOT waste your time flying with @united - wasn't allowed on because I arrived 35 minutes before the departure of a delayed flight!
@united you guys suck don't you? https://t.co/NrnpT2OrJN
@united Your company should be embarrassed-Hope they sue the shit out of you-Fear of autism forces family off plane http://t.co/C4jbNeULkU
@united There is no justifying this. Train your crews to provide better service and no "behavioral problems" ensue. http://t.co/SgNJ6ry1Sr
Hey @united. You better get some training for your employees. The situation that happened with the family &amp; autistic girl is NOT okay.
So I got a meal voucher bc my @united flight was delayed 4 hrs wanna guess what I was able to buy?
@united flight delayed this morning. Only to be re-routed 600 miles in the opposite direction and experience another delay. #fiasco
@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent. what is going on!!!

@DeltaAssist shame when your system fails to put Diamonds on the upgrade list for the DET/MSP leg flight 512 today and no one knows why.
@AmericanAir flight 1357 held on Tarmac while they de-ice a plane in front of gate 40 - come on dispatch planning! http://t.co/rppVHddjUx
@AmericanAir flight 1521 - unacceptable that we were delayed 2.5 hours for airplane maintenance and over an hour wait for luggage at LAS!!

@DeltaAssist waited over an hour and no bag.....lost an hour on road for no bag...hoping for refund on flight

Disappointed with southwest's apathy of stranding passengers for 4 days in an airport @SouthwestAir
@JetBlue You're kidding me right ! I'm not #mosaic anymore all of a sudden ? #fail

I'm on this @americanair flight and have the RUDEST flight attendant named Jessica that I've ever encountered
@aayoub @Delta @DeltaAssist in other cases of harassment and disorderly conduct that plane would have been escorted back. Disgusting Delta.
@coopmavs @AmericanAir @TSA Let us know of you get an answer #frustrating

Missed the bag check-in cut off by 6 mins and NO one at @AmericanAir could help me make my 8am flight. Understand the 45 minute window...
Shout out to @united for once again overbooking and making us wait hours while they figure their shit out. missed our connecting flight

@SouthwestAir your ticket attendant was so rude!! No meal voucher after a 5 hour delay!! aghhhhh
@united @jaketapper Could. or should the seating problem have been solved earlier by airline ticketing staff or at the gate before boarding?
.@united lost my bag again..... That's twice in a week! #UnitedAirlines #Lost
@SouthwestAir wifi sucks! #ShockedThisTweetGotOut
#IHateUnitedAirlines After another horrible booking experience with @United I remember why I stopped using them. Learn from @SouthwestAir

Flight canceled on @united for tomorrow out of ord. Waited on hold a long time then someone answered and hung up.
@AmericanAir Fuck your baggage handlers.
@SouthwestAir will you take some of that $$ being spent on painting your planes and fix this guitar you broke #heart http://t.co/IdW6TDvrKI
@The40YearOldBoy @AmericanAir @USAirways you could try Kyle Kinane's strategy: shame the fuck out of them. realizing the refund isn't coming
Newark. here I come! @AlaskaAir while you're sending me two hours late. your co-pilot's friendliness has made up for a lot of discomfort.
@foxandfriends BanDelta4Life RT @Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom #Shame on the Airline companies for screwing people over....
@DeltaAssist What's the policy on refunding taxes for a cancelled int'l non-refundable ticket? Agent told me I could. other agent said no.
@united get me to tomorrowworld there faster!!! I'm tired of waiting!! :(
@united any idea why our flight is delayed? Now almost 3 hours without an explanation other than "delayed incoming flight" 😔

@Delta @DeltaAssist terrible service today. 8 flights in the last week. trip disrupted. first class ticket taken away at the gate. #fail
@SouthwestAir can I get a refund on my early check in fee. seeing as how your flight was delayed and now im stuck in the stupid middle seat.
@DeltaAssist why when I submit a complaint via your website and request a reply it has been over a week and I have heard nothing?
Lost bag. Current telphone customer service hold time for @AmericanAir is &gt;1 hr. Is that reasonable?
@HoodieAllen @united or more likely its you that stinks! ðŸ™ŠðŸ˜˜
Nothing like starting off 2015 w a 3 hour wait while @AmericanAir unsuccessfully search 4 my suitcase they lost #stilllost #lostcustomer
@goblueforce @DangeRussWilson @AlaskaAir no he won't. Only way is if the pats cheat. #cheaters #DeflateGate #cheatingAGAIN #BeleCHEAT #haha
@DeltaAssist plus I'm sitting in Comfort+ and no premium snacks were offered. Poor experience today. Very poor.
@mareanathanson @JetBlue cant believe they haven't issued the advisory. Would save them a lot of complaints if they just did it now
@DeltaAssist offering half my plane $800 vouchers but delay wife and my flight twice downgrade plane downgrade cabin sit us apart &amp; nothing
My @AlaskaAir app figured out that I was in the airport and popped up. I didn't have the heart to tell it that I'm cheating on it this time.
@united AGAIN living up to your horrible rating. R U ever on time #alwayslate
@AmericanAir WORST and most UNORGANIZED airline I've ever experienced. Been sitting on the plane waiting to take off for 2 hours!#NEVERagain

@stephenfry @AmericanAir @united try LIAT in the Caribbean. Worst airline ever! Makes American look first class!!
Hey @JetBlue - your uncanny willingness to cancel flights just cost us $630. Thanks for passing on the burden! #NiceStaffTerribleAdmin
@SouthwestAir can someone explain why my 9:30 flight from DIA to Midway is delayed 8 hours?
@JetBlue There were no options but a credit. Not acceptable. You've now lost my business and that of my 1200 travelers. All over $25! #greed

@DeltaAssist flew SYR to ATL this AM. DISAPPOINTED in snack Svc. were told snacks not avail. plane was out!Unacceptable considering airfare
@united It was boarding. Those people changed a shitty diaper at their seat in biz class. Why does UAL not enforce standards of behavior?
Even though my flight was delayed @JetBlue made up for it by gate checking my second bag 👏
.@JensenAckles @AlaskaAir @jarpad Airlines been getting away with shit for too long. Give 'em hell dudes!!!
Poop. _@stevethebikeguy: @JetBlue announces new bag fees and squeezing out the nice legroom. Well that killed my loyalty._
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac at JFK for over 2 hours. no end in sight
@SouthwestAir your customer service has been god awful. Been trying to get through the phone to change flight plans waited over 1/2 hour
Great my @VirginAmerica flight was just delayed till 7:05. They asked us if we wanted to stay on the plane or go back into the terminal.
Another day. still missing my bag that @united lost last week. Still no answers. no comp. no response to my formal complaint.

@chadstirling @united dude I just got the same thing in Denver. Been on the road 6 weeks and it's always the last flight home that's screwed
.@alaskaair thanks for loading us all on the plane and then making us sit for an hour to wait. Dick move. Flt 127.

@united big fail tonight arrive at airport. and offered early flight. Get to gate and flight delayed by 3 hours. No seat on original flight!
@JetBlue Why were the TVs not working on flight 101 last night? I was stuck watching a loop of the pre-flight video for 5 1/2 hours!
The whole world is watching Peter Pan and the Bears game. and I'm boarding a plane with no TVs. What is this madness? @AlaskaAir
@Mirror_Editor @AmericanAir You need to kick off more than that. I did &amp; bag was at my front door before i got home from OC airport

@UnitedFleetWebs sad day for the Saul Bass #UnitedTulip. Now it's time to come up with more inspiring livery for the @united fleet.
Paid ONE MILLION DOLLARS to ride @AlaskaAir 1st class &amp; there's no radio or TV. No streaming sites. @GogoInflight player fails on Mac. BOO!!
@AmericanAir rip off
Ah @DeltaAssist so frustrating when you change the price of a fare after pressing the purchase button sounds like false advertisement to me
@DeltaAssist @Delta any ETA on website issues being resolved? Horribly slow for the last couple of days (e.g. 2 min to login)
@AmericanAir you guys have 30 min to take off or let us out AA1138. 2h30 min seating on the Tarmac
@USAirways @AmericanAir bad weather shouldn't result in bad service.Very disorganized at CLT. Many ways to make it better. #CustomerService
@JetBlue Just got back from Boston. Great flight. snacks. tv. wifi there not on return. &amp; Potbelly to-go. No complaints #TrickOrTweet!
Sad to see that @JetBlue is about to become like every other airline. It was a good run.
@united bummed: No priority boarding w/ my star alliance gold card which exp 2/15.  I didn't have my mileage + no. due to ticket issue IAH
Had a pretty hi opinion of @VirginAmerica until tonight. Flight currently delayed nearly 4 hrs w/ no explanation.
"@doctorow: fucking hell. @united sucks diseased monkey balls"
@SouthwestAir shame on your flight attendant for not letting my 85 yr old Gma use the restroom even w/ no turbulence. But others can?
@united no response from a complaint dated 21/01/2015 #worstcustomerservice

@AmericanAir I've been waiting at the ticket counter for an hour with @JetBlue it took 5 minutes
@jarpad @AmericanAir OH SHIT DAD STOP THIS
@AmericanAir why is AA2306 delayed. Incoming plane is already there...
@AmericanAir Exactly what I didn't want to hear...  Customer service confirmed an issue but unable to fix and hung up on me.
@DeltaAssist United has delayed me for over three hours due to maintenance.  Any flights leaving nashville to Grand Rapids michigan?
@united. we're stuck at OGG. looks like flight will be cancelled. Can you help? =)
@JetBlue your security checkpoint at JFK NY is the worst.
@AmericanAir what is happening in Miami???  Insane amount of ppl missed their flight tonight.  I shouldn't have to pay for the hotel myself!
@AmericanAir wtf aa? Been 8 hrs on hold and can't  get a single customer service rep on the line
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir hashtag frustrated
@united fucking sucks ass!!!!! shittiest service ive ever experience. never flying thru them again
What is UP with the ridiculous lines at the @SouthwestAir terminal at @PHXSkyHarbor ?? It's insane!!
SWA lost my bag-I hope someone stole it. so when they see my suit theyll think-Wow. somewhere an elephant is missing a suit! @SouthwestAir
@AlaskaAir missed out on using the sign up mileage plan credit but you're still offering it to new sign ups. Can you help?
@AlaskaAir extremely confusing and painfully slow boarding at PDX for flight 404
@bwzimmerman @USAirways @AmericanAir yeah. they suck bad. Change gates all the time at Logan and never a peep from my phone.
@DeltaAssist My 12:30 from LAX to JFK was delayed til 4:51. Anything I can do? (1 of 2)
Looks like I'll reach gold status with @USAirways just in time to get fucked by @AmericanAir rewards program. #loyaltyjustgotbetter
@SouthwestAir need to be clearer that SWA Vaca is not the same. Crappy cust service. Don't care about a list pref or comp pass #noLUV
@united Arrived at LAS on 12/10. my suitcase was missing a wheel. it's nearly unusable. What are my options? #help http://t.co/RcwfOAGym8
Flew @AmericanAir all year and couldn't wait to fly @united again. First thing @united does is treat me like shit. #cantwin
@BD_WONG @united They should send alerts when a flight is *not* delayed. instead of when it is. do you don't get so many texts.
@5NEWSDarenBobb So what you're basically saying is never ever ever fly @united because of their vast incompetent?
@AmericanAir AA 164 SFO-JFK is the most unreliable flight in the world. It gets canceled 9 times out of 10. Never book it!
Great trips (love mexico!) make 4 happy homecomings....especially when it takes @AlaskaAir 24 hours to get you there. #customerservicefail
#edshow  @JetBlue decides to screw passengers in a little tighter and blame it on Wall Street. If flight under 500 miles better to drive.
@united I have never been displaced due to mechanical issues and no electricity at the gate. Horrible guest experience
@dpanabaker @united hopefully not on hold the whole time!!
Sad tweets about @AmericanAir. @Delta &amp; @united remind me why I only go @VirginAmerica. They go everywhere I need to go. Or @VirginAtlantic
@AmericanAir what's the best way to track down my Div Miles nbr? Have phoned 3 times over past 2 days - gave up at 35 min on hold ...
So it turns out @JetBlue didn't fix my booking problem and double charged me. *sigh*.
@united please fix severly delayed UA914. All other flights today to US are booked. I don't want to spend Christmas alone in Paris :(
@AmericanAir pilot on 1243... Reason we have been sitting here waiting for about an hour is all gates have  airplanes needing maintenance.
@united Two vacations in a row dealing with delays. Both times maintenance issues. 😕
@SouthwestAir WN3661 MDW to BWI was cancelled. Will this affect WN3661 BWI to LIT? Looked like MDW origin was a 733 and BWI origin is 737
@VirginAmerica thanks for dumping Philly international - way to screw the tristate area.
@DeltaAssist stuck in Tarmac - hoping not to miss my flight to Santiago Chile -!can you help????
3rd time my flights been delayed tonight. Missing my connection and not gonna get into Seattle until 4am my time. F u @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir is the shittiest airline ever 👎👎👎👎
On @AmericanAir flight from LAX to DFW. Lil delay because Capt says they need to tape a cargo handle to make sure it closes. #gulp
@AmericanAir next to passenger from hell in 36b on flight 106
@southwestair please help me with my ticketing problem. No one has responded.
have never been more upset with any company. @Expedia @united ruined our vacation :(
@AmericasBatRep @united SUCKS!
@JetBlue yesterday we had the ABSOLUTE WORST (safely alive) nightmare w/your service. 24hrs later. $650+ extra n' due to delays fixing TVs?!
@Delta &amp; @VirginAmerica screwed up my flight &amp; now instead of flying 14 hours from Australia to LA with my family I'm flying solo #goodwork
@AmericanAir switched gates. overbooked flights. and lost luggage which was inevitable given the hectic disorganization of the flights.
@united   Is it because we arrived 90 minutes late that no one can tow us into the gate?  Unbelievable.
@DeltaAssist I've been on hold for hours to try and find out a question on my Delta voucher.  Who can assist me?
@AmericanAir Not a fan of your wifi service on this flight. #Flight1144 #slow
Hey @AmericanAir way to blind us at dinner with your shitty ad http://t.co/HX8vSi39hY
So apparently those cost synergies didn't take into effect yet @AmericanAir @USAirways This the third consecutive worst flight experience
@JetBlue very disappointed..flight 403 out of JFK delayed all day. no information and no real help #youtalkshit #thoughtyouwerebetter
@united May not book United again because ur 9/9 flight left early &amp; u gave our 4 First Class seats away. Almost missed a contracted show.
Making matter worse @AmericanAir plane was late to WV making us late to DFW. Missed connecting flight along w/15 other people. #dontflyAA
#BadCustomerService @united yelling at customers and hanging up on them. What has happened to your company?
Never fly @AmericanAir. Worst flying experience. Three hour delay to San Antonio and three hour delay back. Get your act together.
Nothing like being an hour late because @AmericanAir forgot to take the plane out of the hangar... 
2 canceled flights. 2 hour wait but @VirginAmerica got me home.
Sadly. I could have waited an gotten a much less expensive flight. Annoyed at @AmericanAir  Saved around $200 if I'd waited! I could use $$!
@AmericanAir I am still waiting on an answer to why when I told you this in my March 7 tweet you still told me submit a complaint?
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
I can't begin to express how disappointed I am at the recent. repeated poor service from @AlaskaAir Used to be best in the biz.
@DeltaAssist filed a complaint during the week. The app keeps crashing and other customers had the same problem. Check reviews on App Store
@AmericanAir what is going on with your website? had a trip on hold. go to pay and it's all wonky.
@united is flight UA #4294 still on for 10:20 out of SAV. It was delayed bc of mechanical issues earlier
@AmericanAir should we/when should we be concerned there is no gate info for flight 4273. set to leave DCA in about 45 min?
@DeltaAssist member number 6899122698. Flight cancelled. Need help.
@DeltaAssist Flt leaving SAV is delayed &amp; may miss connection in ATL. Need to join standby for flt 1066 @ 9:58a ATL-BNA in case. Help?
Um @AmericanAir are there no power plugs in coach on the 321Ts? I'm stuck on Tarmac and can't find/see one????
@AmericanAir seriously? you cancel a thousand flights and don't even have a line i can wait on hold? this is ridiculous.
Come on @AmericanAir...get my ass to SAT already. On 2nd plane at DFW...and we have sat on this one at the gate for 45 minutes. #fail
@Delta @DeltaAssist DL468 SFO-&gt;JFK emergency landed in SLC for an apparently loud boom that only 1st class cud hear? Now stuck 4 paperwork?!
My @united flight was 3 hours late. and now they are making me pay to rebook the connection I missed.
@united My Aunt was asked to share room w stranger in Houston after flight delay. Unacceptable. Best way to contact live person?
@SouthwestAir Flight delay + baggage delay = missing the last trains from BWI to DC til 2am. Help paying for a shuttle?? #southwestair
@TravlandLeisure A8 that's a tough one. airlines are making it more imposible to get status. disappointed in the @united changes #TL_Chat
â€œMinorâ€ H2O valve issue sent 5:40pm ET flight back to gate for fix. Now we return for more fuel because of â€œweatherâ€ near Lima. cc @JetBlue
@united very disappointed that you don't even follow your own standard of honoring fares. #unitedfail
@DeltaAssist Why won't the Delta app work to check in on intl flight? Wont let me view alternate flights after a delay either.
@AmericanAir c'mon AA. we've now been waiting on the tarmac for close to two hours... #flight1446. Just want to get home.
Truly despise trying to work with @AmericanAir  Someone stop me if I ever suggest flying on an AA flight again. #frustrating
@Frommers @Delta sucks for rewards. We hope @AmericanAir. @united and @JetBlue won't follow suit. Btw our loyalty is with @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir able to get on it. but still confused on how you overbook? We are sitting in Houston now w/the same problem. #bookingfail
@Delta is literally the WORST tell me why they cancelled my flight the day of for no reason and a 2 hour wait over the phone?? @DeltaAssist
Guess who hates @united #whereisthecustomerservice http://t.co/2SgLoVKyg6
The more people I talk to @AmericanAir the more I'm shocked at how terrible their customer service is! #fail #stillbagless
@MaggieLindemann @SouthwestAir South West fix your problems
Muslim chaplain @TaheraHAhmad discriminated against. harassed &amp; humiliated on @United flight http://t.co/vkDQ2ltJx8 #unitedfortahera
Surprise. surprise. @united screws up my return flight just as badly as my flight up last week! Never flying them again!!!
@USAirways has horriable service when it comes to @AmericanAir passengers #fail
Here at Dulles waiting for our flight with @SCI_Official because they have "overfueled the plane." Is that real @united?
@SouthwestAir Family boarding w/ 1 kid. 2 parents &amp; 2 grand parents is a joke. The grandparents need to be told to wait in line. but aren't.
Worst CSR #Conrad @JetBlue #23 gate 24  Training badly needed.....:(
@AirCanada @AmericanAir my bag got lost at some point between Charlotte NC and Toronto. Canada today. and all you offer is 20 dollars?
@united this just gets worse. 30 days still no response from CS and ignored my DM that you told me to send. Awful customer service!
Spin .@JetBlue. spin! These new announcements are not getting me excited. And I'm still waiting for that Windows Phone app.
@AmericanAir 2nd plane...2nd delay... Not sure your business model is working
@bewareofblair @AmericanAir That totally sucks. I hate when companies aren't sympathetic and don't want to work with people
@AmericanAir why are your ground staff at LAX not acting on multiple requests from Qantas to forward my delayed luggage? #frustrating
.@NCAI1944  Pres.: "[@Verizon. @BestBuy. @HP. @united] [d]oesnâ€™t [@Redskins] harken back to the worst of Americaâ€™s failures?" #SOIN2015
Before merging with another airlines. you should prob get your shit together! @americanair! Grrrrr!! #NeverAgain #AmericanAirlines! 👎👎👿👿
@united if you cancel a flight. forcing your MileagePlus Gold member to rent a car. your policies should include reimbursing for said rental
Serious issue with @JetBlue flight from NYC to lax. Didn't check my sisters luggage with the rest of us and your customer service is shit
@AmericanAir First time flying business class with you on #AA81 to Dallas and it has to be the worst Business class I've ever seen. Shocking
@AmericanAir need one or two agents to help customers at MKE with delayed flights please
An hour after our original boarding time and I am finally getting on the plane @SouthwestAir ugh! #ThankSouthwest
@AmericanAir Was complaining about the waiting period and the fact I have to dig up a number... do you not keep track of who flew with you?
@AmericanAir cancelled my flight. 9 attempted phone calls and 2.5 hrs on hold still can't reach a person. No communication for AA whatsoever
@DeltaAssist DL7329 from LGA to IND was delayed more than three hours with no explanation. I am disappointed.
You will. @AmericanAir. In a time of notoriously bad service amongst US airlines. it really is the small stuff that counts.
@TheWordAlive I'm sorry you guys had to deal with that. especially in Chicago. embarrassing towards @united for having shitty service.
@DarrenKavinoky @united I will pay more and fly longer to avoid flying United. @VirginAmerica @JetBlue and @SouthwestAir are always great!
@amhdeleon @DeltaAssist Shameful scam @aeromexico is doing. Faulty board. no gate announced. and clients forced to pay twice to fly home!
@AlaskaAir Had a poor cust. svc. exp. just now with flight from SEA-DCA.  Changed seat at check-in. but gate agent undid the change
@AmericanAir seriously?!? 45 minutes for bags to show up and still waiting. 4 bags through at a time. do you take breathers between bags?
@SouthwestAir this luggage check-in at @BWI is RIDICULOUS! I've never had to wait longer than 15 min to check a bag for any SW flight.
@AmericanAir fri 3170 delyd 5 tms. cancelled.   Drv to ORD dlayd &amp; no AdClub.  Today MCO153-ORD dlayd &amp; still have 2.5 hr drv to CMI#sucks
Yup now entering #hour9 at newark again shoutout to @united for being bad at things like getting passengers on planes?? U had 1 job United
@AmericanAir delayed baggage still not located 3 days after the flight. Want to speak to a real person
@SouthwestAir is Customer Relations (214) 932-0333 down? Busy signal. You cancelled a flight. agreed to a refund. but it hasn't arrived.
Delayed in Aruba today Feb 15 due to Flight 722 cancellation .. Looking for help re: Hotel Expenses.  @DeltaAssist
@SouthwestAir has greatly disappointed me as a customer! They literally stole my money with their points system. #scammed
@united I've got a cousin stuck at IAH trying to make it to SEA for my graduation ceremony tomorrow can you help?
Hey @DeltaAssist I get things happen and today #LGA was a bad day. But why haven't I gotten my bag back after two hours at Carousel C6?
@united totally understand and wud never expect specific seat but aisle to middle after holding boarding pass w/o justification is just rude
@united never fails. flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me. other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@AmericanAir is an extremely dissatisfying airline. I will never ever use them for any reason. So much for seeing my mom this weekend.
@united Midway: 20 min delay to get off plane bc they don't have a skybridge driver &amp; 50 min delay to get bags. Apparently only one driver?
@AmericanAir I have been on hold for 45m! My flight is delayed. but now I cant get on the earlier flight bc you won't pick up the phone!
. @JetBlue my flight that i never booked to England. yeah... The tickets never came. pls give me full round trip now pls thx k bye
@alaskaair we stood at the window and watched our plane leave. They wouldn't let us board being one minute late. Ruined Bachelorette party.
fuck @AmericanAir and your penalty fees.
@SouthwestAir flight from Tampa to Bwi cancelled and been on hold forever...
@SouthwestAir on some bullshit
@DianeNeal @united So sorry you are dealing with this. I've had it with airline issues!
I swear to god. @AmericanAir selects for rude. unhelpful employees intentionally. It's the only way to explain my experiences.
@americanair worst customer service ever.
Nothing like being told to bored then waiting on the jetway for the crew to show up for 20 mins #lifeoftravel #roadwarrior @united
.@united Please explain to me how you don't realize you're copilot is delayed 3+ hours until after you've boarded first class? Please.
trying to checkin for @JetBlue flt and I'm not able to pick a seat #shady hope they're not overbooked. holiday travel frm hell has started):
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half late but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@united brutal it was 1191 or 1192 horrific experience
@JetBlue  if you have unused miles. gift them to a charity so they don't go to waste &amp; others benefit before switching to another airline.
@ChelseaGrinUT @Delta @DeltaAssist Delta can suck my ass if they don't recover CG's shit. Because I've been way too hyped on this show.
Flying with @united today has been such a nightmare that I never want to fly again.
@AmericanAir We need to talk. You cancelled my flight. then gave away my 1st class seats on the next flight 3 hrs from home #CustomerService
@united We are having major communications issues with operators trying to book a flight with credit. Could you please assist with a contact
@AmericanAir my flight was cancelled but I can't through to an agent. How do I rebook?
@SouthwestAir I have tried to call customer relations for past 8 days. Sent an email saying this is a problem y'all tell me to call. Help?
@united I read the article about your issue with a passenger named Ivy. I will under no circumstance ever fly on your airline.#boycottUnited
@united Flight was delayed 2 hours. my bags have been lost and now I've been waiting at the United desk for 30 minute http://t.co/N756GU0akJ
@united iAd to Pittsburgh on Labor Day... Pilot was 90 min late...
The words I dread hearing: "Folks. it's gonna be a completely full flight." #ugh #LAXBWI @SouthwestAir
Interesting flight @jetblue. Board &gt; taxi &gt; back to gate &gt; deplane &gt; wait because "the computers" are being replaced 😂
@united I volunteered to give up my seat on a flight. and made arrangements to fly out tomorrow. But I've now been waiting 3hrs for my bags.
@JetBlue I'm done flying you.  Always overbooked. constantly getting screwed on seating. DONE!
First #United you cancel my flight from IAH to CLT and I had a 5 and a half hour layover at IAH from a 4 hr flight from SEA @united
@united at what point does your airline make a gesture of at least providing credit or voucher? &gt;4hrs delayed is a lot of wasted time and $
@united waiting 2 hours to fail to get our bags back is not "fluid" operations.   That's "poor" operations.  No clue where they are.
@united is by far the worst airline I've ever flown. Everyone I know who has flown them has had a bad experience. http://t.co/k0qAmnj9yQ
Trying to call @AmericanAir for two days and their dumb computer keeps hanging up on me won't even let me wait an hour #badcustomerservice
Another disappointing interaction with @DeltaAssist. #terriblecustomerservice. Agent David put phone down on me
@AmericanAir flight 157 from DFW to PDX stuck in the sky bridge for a maintenance issue on the plane. #seriously #fixthencheckin
@mboute @AmericanAir this nonsense needs to stop ! @AmericanAir needs to show us respect #Haiti
Flight from RDU 2 IAH delayed by almost 2 hrs. Fingers crossed I can make connecting flight 2 SFO #longlayover @CheapOair @united
@FergusonMelanie I was sad when @united didn't give an elderly man with diabetes a hotel voucher. That was tragic.
No ground crew at EWR Hub..Normal. But priority baggage handling only helps if bags eventually come out. It's been 30 minutes. @united #fail
THANKSGIVING TRAVEL NIGHTMARE UPDATE: went from 2 hr delay to 4.5 hr delay. #delayallyouwant #justdontcancelplease #getmehome @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist I just booked a flight and your system truncated flyer's middle name because it is too long.  Will that be an issue with TSA?
@FrontierCare last time I ever fly your airline tomorrow. Off to fly @SouthwestAir from now on. Terrible business practices by @FrontierCare
@AmericanAir is terrible and so are their employees at DFW. Witnessed the rudest behavior I have ever seen here. Not flying again with them.
@united I hate this airline. Cancelled my flight SFO to NRT due 2 engine issues. I still have to pay for my Tokyo hotel! Lost a Friday night
Once again @AmericanAir delay on flight 1153 too bad! #noflightAA
@AmericanAir  Get your stuff working properly. Seriously? Walk us from a faulty one to another which was already faulty? #sucks
@AmericanAir was en route to honeymoon today. Stuck in DFW b/c mech issue on  AA280. Missed connection to Nassau + first night hotel. DM pls
@EmmaWWE omg that sucks  @AmericanAir better do something about this!
@PhilGizzi @AmericanAir @YouTube AA shame on you.Your customer support is 0. I've filed complaints with you and you shrug it off.#con #fraud
@united so frustrating siting at the gate because United doesn't have anybody to operate the jetway.
@deltaassist 8:39 is a lie.  Took off @ almost 10.  Why does jfk fail so hard?  Where do I get those 3 hours back? http://t.co/piT1r2qdea
@AmericanAir once again delays at dfw almost make me miss connector! #dfwtf
@united Delayed. again. &amp; missing our connection from San Francisco to Eugene Oregon. The only other flight to Eugene from San Fran is full
@DeltaAssist its really hard to do that when the red coat supervisor and the rude agent are buddy buddy.
@united worst airline!!! 5hr delay is bs
Of the 5 @AmericanAir flights I've been on this trip 4 have been delayed so extremely that I've been 2 days behind schedule since last week.
. @AmericanAir has already put @Lexagator on hold for the past 5+ hours.  It's getting ridiculous.
@united ua1759 directv card swipe broken then pay for wifi and all I get is no service for 2hrs. Hope ua77 is better. http://t.co/oMkYcBoMCI
@DeltaAssist Locked out of my account. Waited and talked to cust service and told to wait 24 hrs. Seems crazy to have to wait that long.
@AlaskaAir So upset with your service! It's been 24 hrs and my luggage is still missing. I won't be flying with you guys anymore.
@SouthwestAir u cancel a ticket while the guy is on the plane and don't refund him? You guys are better then that.
It really pisses me off when you guys won't open up a fucking seat for a US soldier trying to get home for Christmas. @AmericanAir
NEVER fly @AmericanAir under any circumstances...even life or death. #TheySuck
On hold @AmericanAir for 1 hr 45 mins. Website will not allow changes. #terribleservice
@JetBlue Kicking 6'4 girl out of empty exit row cuz she didn't pay upgrade. Our travel party of 20 will find a new airline to fly next time.
@AmericanAir I've waited patiently for a refund from a connector flight that took off early. No refund yet. Better business will be notified
New @VirginAmerica site is all screwed up. The drop downs won't scroll. New interface hard to work with. Fix it guys. I'm giving up :-(
Hey @SouthwestAir. 128 planes with "missed" MX inspections? Those @BoeingAirplanes really aren't going. are they?
More lies from @Delta!Told no overhead space.Had to check bag.There is PLENTY!Even flight attendants didn't call.@DeltaAssist. I have pics!
@AmericanAir I need to reschedule a cancelled flight. Flight # 2534 from DFW to CRP.
@jessiechar too bad @AmericanAir is fucking useless.
@AmericanAir #lilmamas are waiting.  Tick tock.
@SouthwestAir wrapped around the axle again 2 hours late leaving PHL and now we are waiting in Chicago http://t.co/n1ZHuUbvcB
Had the worst flying experience with connecting flights today with @united today. #neveragain
Flight cancelled last night. Now this morning. screen in cockpit doesn't work. Hey @AmericanAir. am I ever going to leave Mobile AL?!
@andrewhyde @joestump @united that's ducking unacceptable
@AlaskaAir Hey assholes. why aren't you apologizing for kicking a cancer patient off a plane for no reason? Disgusted with your airlines
After 6 days of inconvenience. and 3 hours of repair work replacing wheels stolen by @SouthwestAir I have 2 working suitcases again.
@AmericanAir can you make a decision on USAir 715 already? Cancel us or provide info. we're stuck on the Tarmac.
@SouthwestAir this delay is ridiculous: I've never heard of people needing to leave the plane b/c it's too heavy. Can we please leave?
From a very respectable reporter. So sad @AmericanAir onboard catering keeps sucking http://t.co/lu2nkCgsH5
@AmericanAir @pztrgtgc Still no bags!Just got auto msg acknowledging a request to delay bag delivery that was NEVER made.  What say u AA?!?
@AmericanAir Now your website and mobile is broken. Can't login to check-in for my flight in a few hours. System maint going on for days now
On a late @united flight between Houston and San Fran http://t.co/sIfW702h5T
Still waiting on @AmericanAir to address the issue of a broken into military bag. @TSA stole over $1.500 of personal belongings. #stolen
Another delayed flight with @united !! This makes 3 in a row! Ridiculous
Dear @SouthwestAir: Your policies (ex: No Show) are increasingly anti-consumer. I'm switching to @AlaskaAir. You've lost your roots :(
@SouthwestAir I know delays are part of flying but it seems you have delays on every evening flight nowadays. Becoming unacceptable!
Shame on you @united !!
@united has got to be the WORST airline ever!!! No for real. and the customer service?? #realmouthy #neveragain #superpissed
@united u must teach your attendants to tell truth. Using FAA regulation excuse incorrectly to make up for delayed flight is unprofessional
Delayed flight... @united we should get an upgrade #hungryhangover
@DeltaAssist by providing me with compensation without going through that terrible online customer service form
@AmericanAir you forgot my dog in NYC  for a checked pet that I paid for and still no customer service or refund! Awful customer service
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled our flight and rebooked us four days later!
@united Fix the issues and get us off the ground #1547. Already been 1 hour and now possibly 1 more. Cmon! Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir $100 for a bag that's a few pounds overweight? That's what @NetPromoter calls bad profit. Won't be promoting AA to my friends.
@united what is the likelihood I will get to Memphis from Denver this afternoon?  my flight is 5522. It has been delayed several times
@united no. I noticed it when home. Then phoned and got a mail address. But no response there at all.
Took off 90min late in DET b/c the plane was frozen (surprise?) now get to sleep on the floor of LAX until morning 👍 @Delta @DeltaAssist
@AlaskaAir when does your check in counters open at Kona Airport? There's a bunch of people waiting in line but no Alaska workers.

Fucking delays keep getting lo ger and longer. Get your shit together @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist its been 30 days now and no response. Any suggestions?
@Delta @DeltaAssist 4/22/15 I had the worst day of my life all because of Delta. If I had to do it all over again I would not of pick DAL.
@AmericanAir Been on Hold with USAir for 2 hours. 1 or 2 flights were cxld. I need to cxl my entire return trip for a refund.
Oh. @united you've done it again.  You gave me hope. but here we go again. Faulty planes and rude gate agents.  #unfriendlyskies

@united worst customer service at the Airport and on the phone
@united why can't you check in for flights departing from Canada? Very inconvenient.
@JetBlue rarely have you let us down but today you screwed up big time. Your plane out of NY is late and 8 of us miss our connection.  (1/2)
@JetBlue what is the delay with fl# 855. when will we be moving from the gate?
@united hi. having a very difficult time locating my lost bag. Customer service also can't find who has my bag now. Can you please help?
What's missing from this @united seat?? I guess I don't need the option of something to watch on a red eye. http://t.co/lSOUhK2jaB
@AmericanAir  Still waiting on my followup with Baggage peeps 😞👎🏻
@clausing83 same thing at BHM that's too much of a coincidence another delay on a different broken plane..@AmericanAir get it together

@DeltaAssist Help! 2524 from ATL to PNS keeps getting delayed. Now nearly an HOUR!
Refused a glass of water on my @AmericanAir flight an hour and a half before we land.. #spittingfeathers #badcustomerservice #thirsty
@AmericanAir - less about the delay. more about the fact no one seems to care. What happened to customer care?

Delayed flight :( @AmericanAir
.@united is 100% the fucking worst.
@AmericanAir got some rude employees
I flew @united and watched them harass a Muslim woman who didn't speak English almost to tears about holding her baby on the flight
Each time I fly @AmericanAir the service gets worse and worse. Enough with the cranky employees. I like you. why do you hate me?!
@SouthwestAir I was told I'd get it back late last night; I stayed up until 3. If you'd like. you can fly me to Dallas so I can look myself.
@DeltaAssist the WORST Service ever at Gerald Ford in GR. MICHIGAN via delta... From the counter to the baggage check in #neverpatrondelta
2 hour delay because @Delta had to change a filter on my watch and on my dime. @DeltaAssist #Delta
@AmericanAir lost a customer today. Current EP member will look to other airlines now. Id bet others on flight 1425 today from Eagle do too.
@EddieTrunk @united and yet the "budget" airline @SouthwestAir gives you TV and snacks . I hate united and usairways is same as united
@DeltaAssist broken seat in business class jfk-mad. Lumbar wouldn't recede. Now in lots of pain. Return options?

Ok @united I'm not thrilled I missed my connection. but Jackie aljoe &amp;  linda were legends getting me on another flight &amp; hotel plans.
@rjgetsetgo @united @AmericanAir What? Shame in that person.
@DeltaAssist why bother allowing a carry on when you always force me to check it anyway? http://t.co/H4M9gu07R7
Got on my @VirginAmerica flight today to realize yall switched my aisle seat to a middle one that doesnt recline. im claustropobic. Great.
@united 1st Class bump LGA. Promised Club pass as part of fix. Get to club. club says nothing in record. Denied entry. Broken promises. Poor
JetBlue adding bag fees. more seats http://t.co/kiOcPlVOak via @USATODAY @JetBlue not a good move for consumers
@AmericanAir Again another flight from Tucson to Chicago delay &gt; 3 hours or outright cancelled. 5 of 6 flights this year like that. Why?
Quick stop in DC but bag-less. @JetBlue really hoping you'll pull through and return my bag b4 South Africa #disappointed #globetrotting
On my last four trips. @united has lost my luggage three times. Three strikes and you're out?
@USAirways @AmericanAir it's been over a month and no response. #travel #charlotte #ignored #safety #faa #vacation http://t.co/tt7tC84IFw
@united a dozen people on last night's cxl'd ORD-LHR flight due to maintenance issues with TWO different planes now about to miss... (1/2)
@united all I want for Xmas is a lost bag that can't be found.  Way to ruin a vacation United. No communication at all. Ridiculous!
@DeltaAssist Flight schedule got changed; is 30 min. enough to transit in SLC and what if origin flight from ORD departs late b/c winter?
@united just want straight scoop on our 3 hour delayed 15 min flight. this 3-4 hour delay has happened twice in a row now...rented a car
@AmericanAir Sad and disappointed this issue still hasn't been fixed.
@SouthwestAir why is midway by far the worst airport for baggage claim wait times?
Why my flight delayed 😒 @southwestair
@Bossfishlady Not good. RT:@ksimonetti: Disappointing. @jetblue. Looks like I need a new favorite airline. http://t.co/JxLhyyXeCr
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
How long has @united been flying? Still can't figure out how to calculate a delayed departure time? X mins to board + y minutes in flight =?
Its been over a month since issue and still "Pending Review." too busy with the merger? @AmericanAir AA Ref#1-2470146097
@AmericanAir I've been a loyal AA traveler for nearly 2 million miles. I'm seriously considering a switch today. ORD to LHR on AA86.
@SouthwestAir Why is it that every Southwest flight I have taken in the past 3 years have always been delayed by at least a half hour?
@DeltaAssist Flight was cancelled this AM and I received a rebook email but now that confirmation has disappeared. What's the deal?
So plane #2 is broken as well. Hey @AlaskaAir do you have any good planes in San Diego today?
@united no premiere security at lax on a Friday at 7:30?  Terrible.
I thought @united would be the worst airlines I ever flew on.. Today @SouthwestAir took the cake..
@AmericanAir.   The fat rude lady named Moreno at D36 with the bad hair cut just gave the finger to  a customer .... http://t.co/cisIWlbCs9
@WilliamShatner @Marina_Sirtis @JetBlue - mine was dumped on the Tarmac at Heathrow 'lost' until they looked!  BA - awful service too
I will never EVER be flying @JetBlue ever again

@JetBlue love your airline shame the flight is so short greetings from 36000ft#greatflight
@DeltaAssist I'm so deeply disappointed and angry with Delta. my airline of choice for years. at being downgraded to the bottom
Both of my 3-hour @united flights today had no Wifi or in-flight entertainment. Hard for someone who can't sleep on planes...
@united @indiandutch: @unitedair ua no wifi on 16 hour flight when it's supposed to be there #UA179 #badservice http://t.co/LxtsoWWipu

@CMPunk @AmericanAir there has been alot of people talking bad with the service they've gotten. your not the only one
Apparently it's standard operating procedure for @AmericanAir to not have gate agents. Flight 5772 into AMA had to wait 45 min on Tarmac
@AmericanAir Called web support hotline.  Was told wait was 10 minutes. coming up on 30  :(
Another delay. Just get me to Chicago please. @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir you've failed again.only today your AGENT cancelled  instead of backup booking &amp; gave away my 1st class seat. #sellyourstock
@Smilepatiently: Frustrated. Called @AmericanAir  &amp; @USAirways  2x to verify and told yes can fly standby. now at airport and told can't
@AlaskaAir fly alaska airlines!!  They are the best!  All other suck in the USA!
@united unbelievable no bag abysmal customer service.  I will never fly with u again and I realize that u could careless

@united so glad I paid you guys to leave my bags and provide no help
5 hr flight. massive plane. no leg room. zero closet to hang my suit. @AmericanAir is awful. I sure won't fly it anymore.
@AmericanAir late again! Flight 2332.  You guys are on a roll!  #platinum #missingmeetingsagain
Flights to the Arnold cancelled w/o rebook.  @AmericanAir not picking up (90 min in).  Rebooked paid flights. will get refund later.  #fail
@AmericanAir for gods sake get a ramp agent to Chicago ORD gate G18!!! We have been sitting and waiting to deplane for 20 min!!!
@jetblue your staff at JFK couldn't be more rude. unhelpful and downright nasty. Your customer service today was completely unacceptable.
@united What's going on with flight 3455? Supposed to leave DCA at 2:45 and it's still here. Already missed first day of conference.
@DeltaAssist I just had one of the WORST customer experiences of my life with @Delta customer service. #shameful #willneverflyDeltaagain
There's no A-List check-in line for @SouthwestAir at the #ElPaso airport! We need to fix! They said they get complaints all the time! #diva
@united disappointed so far at response to lost luggage. Should be at LAX. might be in Peru? Report filed. still nothing. #pleasehelp
Come on @AmericanAir and @fly2ohare Almost 2 hours waiting IN the plane for deicing? #letsworkonthat #freecocktail?
@AmericanAir still no response from Customer Relations. Its been 18 days. Is there a better way to contact someone?
@united stinks at ohare.  I travel so much and have earned the gold level yet we have no benefit at security.  What's up with that
@SouthwestAir Flew last week with a four hour delay. And now. another four hour delay. Really?
Worst part of being forced to switch flights: was Group A is now Group C. cmon @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir and phone agent sounded appalled that id ask for some form of compensation/good faith token for 2of2 honeymoon days ruined
Still sitting in the plane. 2 hours. They let us deplane for 15 minutes and now we've been waiting another hour.  @AmericanAir
@BrittNuffsaid @VirginAmerica taking off work early only to be stuck at airport for 3+ = super lame
@AmericanAir on a flight now to LA. delayed over an hour and your entertainment system continues to disconnect

@united I'm at a United hub yet my flight is delayed 3 hrs because you can't find a crew? How is that possible???!
@AmericanAir hey there! Just wanted to see if the ANU&gt;JFK is delayed?
@JetBlue MY LUGGAGE HAS BEEN MISSING FOR ALMOST A MONTH!! I HAVE NOT GOT ANY UPDATES ON WHERE OR WHEN MY BAG IS GOING TO COME!!
@united why is my IAH to AUS flight delayed from 5:40 to 7:50. but the 7:12 flight from IAH to AUS is leaving on time?
I don't remember the time when I wasn't delayed while flying with United Airlines. So unreliable. @united
@JetBlue please issue me a full credit for today.
@united ua3632 late due to maintenance.  Stopped flying ual for 2 months but seems I have same issues as before.
@SouthwestAir whoever at WN is responsible for inflight wifi. please fly United across the US and Delta back to understand your shame.
@AmericanAir Do we get a travel voucher for our inconvenience? I am missing a job interview because the pilot is tired. #AmericanAir
@mattpolites @delta Ugh! @AmericanAir did the same to mine earlier this year.

@AmericanAir emailed AAdvantage for status match ... still waiting.  Can't wait to move from @united but help me out here :)
Waiting on a late plane again.....ahhhhh @united.   You seem to be channeling USAir!
@ged @AmericanAir horrible.
@SouthwestAir can someone explain why plane after plane can take the empty gates and we are stuck with no AC for 20 mins waiting for gate.
Absurdly bad customer service @AmericanAir tonight at DFW. Gate agents and service desk telling different stories
@JetBlue Hello. I experienced an issue with my entertainment display and JetBlue offered me a $25 courtesy credit. It's missing :(
Not stellar travel luck thus far with @united this year.  Non-weather related delay on 3643.  Will I make my 2 pm MST call?
@DeltaAssist why am I unable to buy a ticket with your mobile app?   Atl MCI out dec 5 back dec 9 in first class.  Fails everytime
Why did I get @GlobalEntry if it never works with @AmericanAir should I just not fly #Americanairlines #tsa #jfk #precheck? #frequentflier
@AlaskaAir at gate 9:15pm for 9:45pm flight. u want to leave early so agent said if we went to grab food they would leave us behind. Nice :(
@united why am I paying for your horrible club? At EWR. bathroom closed and internet down. REALLY??
@United says 49 people aboard ExpressJet Flight 4580 that had to turn around and land in Milwaukee tonight.  Plane had mechanical issue.
@JetBlue @PassengerShame a**holes talking over/through poor guy in middle seat entire flight http://t.co/hEfde2W6gE
@JetBlue always great flying with JetBlue.  but never fun when your in flight TV doesn't work!!!  Two hours of a blank screen!
After @AmericanAir flight to Chicago getting cancelled. it's a trip to @drafthouse South Lamar with @ReadySetKatie to ease frustration
@DeltaAssist when will the carry over MQM's be back in the account.  I missing about 175.000 MQM's.
@AmericanAir it's not just rudeness the agent clearly wouldn't do an upgrade in a situation where it is allowable.
@DeltaAssist please help I can't make my flight because this plane is delayed so long and I can't find another option
@united I'm diamond on Delta. never a lost bag. tried UA w family on vacation. $85 for checked bags? Wife and 4 small kids wo clothes. etc!
@united so frustrated! Have been trying to get an operator to change our flight and they hung up for the 3rd time!
@SouthwestAir my flight number 3934 keeps getting delayed. Is it for sure going to take off tonight? Or can you guys help me at all?
Never flying @DeltaAssist again. for how expensive your flights are you should maintenance your planes before boarding
When @United spits on 1K members. it's time to leave &amp; head to @Delta  Read my #travel story: http://t.co/1cI5BQyKMe http://t.co/AGaq9m5v47
I'm not sure why @united hasn't made a weather exception for #SJC - but please get on that so I don't have $200 stolen from me due to greed
Flight home is 3 hours late. At least @SouthwestAir gave us $100 voucher!
Can there be any worse PR for @United than to have @lynn_bartels tweeting her lost luggage mssgs to all 7.900 of her followers? #wowza
Learning new things today. Flying First Class with @AmericanAir isn't enough money to get into the lounge in Philly #Disappointed
@DeltaAssist #sxsw fail. Impact on the Tarmac and only one employee to manage the fallout. So glad I have medallion status.
It's our honeymoon and @DeltaAssist cancelled our return flight for no reason w no update &amp; phone rep hung up on us. Stuck at JFK. Horrible
â€œ@Cybill_Troy: Never flying @AmericanAir ever again. This entire experience has been unacceptableâ€ - We gave up on them years ago!
@united never fails to ruin my travel plans ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘

Pissing away my WHOLE five-hour layover en route to Ireland so we miss the flight? Shine on. @United--you crazy. vacation-crippling diamond.
@Delta @DeltaAssist why does sign say check bag 45 min b4 depart when ur agent says its late if not 45 min b4 board? http://t.co/ZO0EqOvJR8
@ImJakePaul @united they should have warned you guys first before throwing you out of the airport. Plain rude and uncalled for.
@united Hi. I am a frequent flyer and have had problems logging into my account/tracking my info despite contacting support. Help me please.
Seriously. @united you are the absolute worst. I'm almost 1.5 hrs late and will miss my connection.
@united @Xav Keep in mind that sometimes plans have to be cancelled. not changed. and people shouldn't have to pay $200 for life happening.
@united I am sad that you cancelled my flight.  :(. How do I get home now?
@AmericanAir i fly out of Dallas every week. About once a year I give you another try. Same results still waiting for bags 45 min later.
Never fly as a family of 9 on @united !  They change your itinerary and move your already chosen seats. splitting you up!!!!!!!
@United you suck. Your stewardess called me a bitch under her breath today. Classy. @JetBlue all the way from now on. you SUCK @united!
@AmericanAir so far. my connection home is cancelled and the booking agent rolled her eyes at me. was rude and unhelpful. #disappointed
@united I wasn't a connection. @VirginAmerica lost the bag and then found it @flyLAXairport but I was getting on a @united flight

I hate you @AmericanAir
Denied flight home due to 'full' plane. waited over an hour for our 'compensation'. only to be told one of our bags was lost @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how there are no updates on a flight that was supposed to leave 2 hours ago. You guys are a joke!!!
Disappointed with @MyCokeRewards and @SouthwestAir we did not get our coke rewards!
@united yes this being the second time first time things were missing from my bag...things I were told I could recover. Hopefully not again
@DeltaAssist  worst airline and customer service /missing @SouthwestAir  /never again!!
system wide outage this morning and my flights seemingly were the only ones that weren't delayed. well played. @JetBlue. well played.
@JRW_SocialMedia @scarlet_leather @SouthwestAir Full restitution must be made for the shirts. No excuses. They damaged your merchandise.
@AmericanAir of course you guys are not going to do anything because your service is the worst ever!
@chrisdelia @united there it is folks. your weekly sunday night comedian meltdown at united. your terrible company is terrible
@AmericanAir delayed flight. 3 hrs customs. Stood in line for 2 hrs till 12:15 to be told no baggage after 12. Sleeping outside to connect

"@united: We show it departing at 2:49pm. ^HN" I hope it really happens. I've been 6 hours delayed. It's unacceptable. @maldingasea
Hey @united. ur gate agents lied - and allegedly do all the time. Flight attendants say agents never checked w/ them and never do. #greatsvc
Stuck at the airport. Can't remember the last time I had an on time @united departure.
@united: going to miss my connection bc my flight was delayed bc the pilot was missing a piece of paper. Going sfo-den-msy. Can you help?
SO frustrated with @united today. We book how many flights a year?? Today has just been one debacle after another.
@AmericanAir flight 3324 got cancelled from YYZ; got put on @WestJet flight but my checked bags went missing. Reps say to talk to the other.
@AUStinAirport @JetBlue epic fail you 2.   How much longer to we sit on the runway at 12am ??? Ridiculous.
Impressed that @SuperShuttle got me to the airport 2 hours early. Then @SouthwestAir delayed my flight by 2 hours. #bestlaidplans #wompwomp
@rwang0 @SouthwestAir It always makes me sad because it's usually people who can't afford to get kicked off.
Good job @amtrak. No wifi on 8:10 train NYC to DC. Next time. I'm taking @jetblue. #needtowork
@DeltaAssist problems with check in. just sent you message
@VirginAmerica I'm having issues with my bag checkin online. Flying today. Can someone plz call asap. Thx. #help
@Reagan_Airport 's and @VirginAmerica computers down. 2hr delay + flight logs old school. For gods sake just get me to #dallas.
Yo. @united I just flew from Newark to Washington and we're about to have been on the tarmac for as long as we were in the air.
.@VirginAmerica destroyed our great relationship in one single call. Such a shame.
Taipei to DC via SFO. two days of travel delays due to multiple mechanical issues.There should be better support to US military.  @united
I hate @united.
http://t.co/7GS8NF0tUN Shame on you @united for this blatant discrimination!! #unitedfortahera
note to self and everyone else never do curbside luggage check with @united in jamaica #missingjewlery #donttakemycarryon #neverflyunited
What's your reimbursement policy on ruined vacations?? @united
@AmericanAir cancelled âœˆï¸ Dallas to ABQ and delayed CID to Dallas. therefore threatening to #RuinChristmas and all hope of seeing family.
Why can't @SouthwestAir send out more timely delay info? They had to know 335 was late way before 1250 as the plane was coming from ft laude
What complaint KMM24971950V17250L0KM doesn't say. @united: The error you charged me for was on a booking to my mom's memorial service.  #fb
@SouthwestAir you know something is broken in the way you do things when it takes 50 min to board a 737 #neveragain #misery #travel
@FlyFrontier oh yay. Now its 6:10. You guys are terrible. @united wanna pick us up?
@united I need your help with getting mileage credited from my past flights.  Missing 3 of 4 segments!
@DeltaAssist so flight cancelled (dl3696)....and no discounts for hotels...pshh
@ansrthisone @SouthwestAir damn that shit sucks.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for an hour -- can someone PLEASE help me?
@JetBlue no compensation with TrueBlue Points or travel bank credit?!
This flight is delayed an hour now. Never flying with @USAirways or @AmericanAir  again!
@AmericanAir just made me check my bag and there was definitely space for it. #notcool.
Hey @AmericanAir was looking forward 2 a much needed vacation in Central America. But u lost my bag and its day 2. It's hot &amp; I'm n nyc gear
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
@iN_thoseJeanz @AmericanAir mine was Larry. #worstthanksgiving flight. Flying should be easier and customer service should be better. #sigh
Delayed 2 hours out of BOS to DFW on @AmericanAir is understandable. then a rerouted flight path that takes 4 1/2 hours is annoying.....
@SouthwestAir is the shit
.@united will never fly again. Can't believe the lack of compassion of your service people.
@AmericanAir the attitude @ sec. when a woman had water bottle was beyond unacceptable. Know it's important. but it was an innocent mistake.
So there's a gaggle of lost South Carolinians in Dallas-Fort Worth because @AmericanAir changed our gate 7 times in the last ten minutes...
@AmericanAir @USAirways Spent over an hour on your horrible systems/ phone lines just to try to change seats AND was charged twice...
"Maintenance issue" is B.S. excuse du jour for @united Back 2 back plans afflicted. Result: Get in at least 4 hrs late. miss Easter w/ kids
Remember that crisis I somehow averted when I flew over here 2 weeks ago? It's happening again! Never flying @AmericanAir again.
@iamwill @ba @Quantas @KoreanAir @SingaporeAir @united perhaps not keen on a diva being onboard irritating other passengers - go@united
FUCK @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir @USAirways I have flown 19 flights with you all in the last 11 months and I have never made it to my destination on time.
@JetBlue terrible experience and service  today on flight 752. What's the best way to get you the details
@DeltaAssist Luggage did not make transfer in ATL to LHR on BA226 on 12/19. 4 of 5 bags still missing. 28 hrs &amp; no info provided at all.
Note to self. never taking @AmericanAir flights again.
@united you missed the point. Easily it could have been reported wifi was broken &amp; customers automatically refunded. Now it's my problem.
@VirginAmerica @GlennF I had the exact same problem. Offer mailed to me doesn't match the offer online and not code. Can you look into this?
@AmericanAir yet another delayed flight AA1658. Moreover. two empty seats on BC and did not upgrade me. Is it because of my tweets...?
aye fam. your plane needs to leave already @AmericanAir
@dworksout @VirginAmerica Fly @AmericanAir next time you travel. Friendly flight attendants. But horrible leg room.
Every time I fly @SouthwestAir the flights are freaking delayed. Ahhhh I knew I should've stuck with @JetBlue damn this is nuts!!!!
@united please don't tell me I need to switch airlines... @AmericanAir is a step ahead on this one.. http://t.co/sV2A57B0EC
@tenderlove @searls @united there must be some reason but heck if I can see the value in not just calling these "connections"
@AmericanAir after personally spending on necessary accommodations&amp;26 hours late I’m back.rebooking wasn’t problem. The 1st mentioned was!
Did Netanyahu say anything about how horrible @united is? Because they are.....they're horrible. Don't fly @united
Once again @AmericanAir make everything complicated. Worst airline ever! Why? Why???
@united what the heck?!? How will I watch @UofDenver Pios play in the NCAA championship game with this BS set up? http://t.co/42Rkd3fh1f
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for nearly five hours to rebook my flight? Any chance I'll get through to a sales agent any time soon?
@united First. you cancel my flight. then make me stow my carry-on and leave it in Chicago. This is why I fly @SouthwestAir.
Sitting on flight 407 in Boeing airfield because @united is the only airline not allowed to land at sea/tac  @united you suck balls
Screw @united my hearts with @SouthwestAir ~
@GrahamDeLaet @united worst airline there is! @WestJet the best.
@AmericanAir I just want to say your cancellation policy really stinks.
@SouthwestAir this is the worst flight ever! Delays and poor communication by your staff is a joke $100 voucher is not enough. Flight302
@AmericanAir rude gate agent at DFW lied to us and forced checking bags. When corrected she threatened to pull me from flight. Horrible
I joined twitter just to point out how incompetent @united and @Expedia are. Don't cancel the return flight when the to flight is changed.
I hate that my flights always get delayed flying with @SouthwestAir .
Yo @AmericanAir you got some rude employees.
@SouthwestAir telling someone to wait 1 HOUR for their bag is completely unacceptable. I might leave you over this! #Flight646 #Fail
Airport complainers are so embarrassing. but if you want to slip me some points for this 3-hour delay. I'd happily accept @DeltaAssist.
@ImamSuhaibWebb this deserves an endless retweet so everybody knows how sucks @united services are ðŸ˜¡
@SouthwestAir #2777 Sitting waiting for an open gate after already being late is terrible. Next flight in 10min.bags won't make it to TPA
So @AmericanAir I'm going to need you all to get this baggage thing together. First a lost bag. then a list carousel. Yeah. umm...
@SouthwestAir Do baggage handlers not like wheels.  Lost another one today on a checked bag.
I'm sad @JetBlue is making those changes to their policies. I'm sure I'll be flying @SouthwestAir more now
There is a fucking power outlet on this plane ilysm @AmericanAir 😭❤️ http://t.co/QcKLcdiw11
@AlaskaAir. thanks for 2hr+ delay @ SEATAC while you figure out how to do maintenance. Couldn't figure this out before we boarded?
@united We will provide complete details in a complaint letter re: the horrible service she has received in 3 attempts to get out of #BDL
.@AmericanAir you guys have the worst customer service in the world. From being told we will 100% refund to $0. Embarrassing.
7-8 hours with this thing. I hate you. @united http://t.co/H4BCKqExfe
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
@SouthwestAir there is an issue with bags at Hobby in Houston. It should not take 45 minutes for bags to start rolling. I suggest you fix.
@SouthwestAir  do you have a scanning system to track lost baggage?
@_austinjacob @AmericanAir is awful. I've had issues with them too
@DeltaAssist I'm really needing helpI'm missing my bags which unfortunately had to check due to my eye medications(drops) container
@SouthwestAir hello??? Is anyone alive out there???? Been trying to call for over 3 hours??? Put on hold with no luck!?!?!?
@AmericanAir Flight 4131 to St. Louis is delayed. 60 mins ago we were told we'd be updated after 20 mins. Gate crew vanished 30 mins ago..?
@DeltaAssist why is flight DL5283 delayed #MSP #YXE?
Worst airline ever....never again @AmericanAir
@united flight 550 from pdx to Denver delayed an hour. Missing connection now. Paying $100+ now to stay overnight. Terrible experience.
Clearly. I suck at airport travel. Boarding position C 26 on my @SouthwestAir flight. Probably back of the plane between Bubba 1 &amp; Bubba 2.
.@SouthwestAir Why do I lose 60+ boarding positions on rebooking b/c of your late flight. Why should I pay for your delay w/a #MiddleSeat
@AdamSinger i've never flown with them! maybe i will the next time i head to SFO... @VirginAmerica
@SouthwestAir you suck
@VirginAmerica your website login is unusably bad. I can’t log in. I change password. new password doesn’t work. Repeat forever.
The day we wrapped series on good service. @AlaskaAir has given worst I've seen. 24hrs at #yyc w/ 2 flight cancellations &amp; 0 communication.
Airlines never cease to get worse and worse customer service. @united is the worst
@AmericanAir up to the same ol shhh! Terminal changes. multiple delays at DFW! This is getting old! #1501 #nocustomerservice
4.5 hr delay of @united 881 on 10/24 for repairs caused major disruptions of travel. Will arrive PUS 15 hrs late! Not okay. esp for 1K.
@AmericanAir @ProfessorCrunk Amazing(in the worst possible way) that it took this long for a response. I will not be using yr services.
@AmericanAir for a sick passenger and now we re just sitting and waiting ugh! This is so inconvenient! They need to get on the next plane
F*ck @JetBlue up their unimpressive butthole. I've never been so disregarded as a customer. Its disgraceful. calling them an airline. #mess
Remind me to never fly @SouthwestAir again. Shit is worse than greyhound.
@united Just passed &gt;20 ppl waiting for $0 gate check MKE-CLE with 13 bags on belt inc our 3x$25. Why not charge gate check?
Lesson from this trip. never flying @AmericanAir again!
I swear I hate @AmericanAir 😡
JetBlue will cut legroom. charge for checked bags. NOT A GOOD MOVE @JetBlue  http://t.co/PfMrt9xlrb #ttot #jetblue #airlines
Damn. @united. I get it if a plane breaks or there's bad weather. but how do you cancel a flight b/c you don't have a first officer? Lame.
@AmericanAir why do you RJ 900s have fake windows? When I paid extra for preferred with a window. it sucks. http://t.co/BvDUF4sqDI
Fuck you and your watered down sprite @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist flt delay to PIT. On the plane in first class is peanuts pretzels and cookies.  Same in coach. Why did I pay for upgrade
Two phone calls and a letter to @DeltaAssist and no response about my flight on @Delta last week. Is Twitter the way to get through to them?
NEVER FLY @united. rude employees. always a bad experience. they are crooks: $200 for a change fee plus the difference. I want @JetBlue back
@united just had a terrible experience with your staff at the checkin counter this morning.
@DeltaAssist I am trying to pay for a flight that was reserved and expires at midnight tonight!  I've been on hold for 2 hours!
@SouthwestAir too bad I live in Topeka. KS. I could use some Rapid Rewards points. :(
@Amburglar_ @AmericanAir THAT'S YOUR FUCKING RESPONSE? if
Flight Attendant says "I'll BRB" and goes MIA for 30 min. delaying a flight... This is why I don't fly @AmericanAir #AA204
@JetBlue we did but that's not helping us get our bag now is it? never again will we fly JetBlue ever! it was our first and last time
@united Need to file complaint about this overall experience. Could you please provide a point of contact?
@IIJERiiCHOII @VirginAmerica They have to be one of the worst commercial airlines on record. I swear. They always mess stuff up.
Every time I fly @USAirways it makes me miss @SouthwestAir
Less than two hours til our flight on @SouthwestAir and there's about 100 people in line waiting to check bags and zero attendants...
@tears_go__by yes. stuck in Dallas. @AmericanAir No. 1601 from JFK to DFW was delayed due to transport pickup of Miami Crew from hotel.
@AmericanAir You've cancelled my flight. your website is down and your automated phone service hangs up on me. How do I get a hold of you?
At the airport. One hour from a long overdue takeoff. Please don't cancel my flight again @United
@DeltaAssist Nevermind. Crew timed out AND the plane is broken. Looks like we'll be in the terminal all night with an infant.
@AmericanAir I take it your no response means no?
@DeltaAssist no. I was told it would come in later but it's delaying me for getting work done but I will
@JetBlue No accommodations for those people who have been trying to get home to Boston from DFW since Friday morning? So Disappointed.
How can @SouthwestAir tell me in the AM that my flight is delayed and then revert back to the original time? Welp. hope I make it.. #aimconf
@DeltaAssist need some help. Stuck in a middle seat on tonight's DL468 to Israel. Can you help a loyal Delta flier out?
@united ua712 cancelled after 1.5 hour wait in full checked-in cabin. reason: no pilots available to fly the airplane in houston!
Could @united be anymore unhelpful? Stuck in Denver. Hotel voucher is useless. No rooms available. They won't even give us cots.
How I wish #Delta would upgrade my trip. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I feel like I'm the only one who has never been upgraded @DeltaAssist @Delta #please #havemercy
@united I have waited for a reply. it said 10-14 days. it's past that.... I still haven't gotten a reply
Love how @VirginAmerica simply ignore any complaints about their levels of service. Shocking.
@united sucks at customer service.We #BoycottUnitedAirlines and we are thankful to you for showing us your filthy self. it makes us stronger
Two mechanical issues on last leg @AmericanAir - confirmed on another flight. now bag mishap. 28 hours of travel &amp; this? #soclose #fail 😩😴😞
Hey @AmericanAir Paula at LAX Gate 40 needs customer service re-training. esp WRT your Gold Aadvantage members. Never had such bad treatment
United sucks. my luggage hasn't even been delivered yet. @united  I was told it would be here at 9:30. It's currently 12:23.
That moment 3 hours before departure. when @AmericanAir says they've cancelled your flight home. #notsohappy
@VirginAmerica whhhhhat is going on!! #FOMO40 not working!  Agent said it was a mistake #poorcustomerservice
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
Flight is nearly 4 hours delayed and @united can't even comp the DirecTV service.
@MMViverito I had similar problem w  @JetBlue last week. Best if u both DM and call (tho their hold times are nuts).
@jordanbks And bootleg ass @AmericanAir wouldn't let me choose my seat ahead of time and then CHARGED ME for a window seat at check in. UGH.
@AmericanAir bag was to be in Aspen.  7 reps. 2 supervisors. Terrible service.  Bob Boland found it in ASP.  Hero.  All else rude.
Ugh @SouthwestAir - def not the best flying experience. #disappointedbride
Sitting at gate after already being delayed when it's almost 10pm with 4 kids stinks @SouthwestAir at least they finally told us due to bags
@DeltaAssist #WhereAreMyBags Bags removed from Flt 5606 GGT to ATL Wed due to weight issues. Nobody can tell me when they'll return. Help us
@united could you guys please tell me what's the correct gate and time for flight 1047 newark to boston? Cause it's a mess here
Fly #LikeAGirl Thank U @JetBlue 4 highlighting these badass pilots! @TNH_Tweets   http://t.co/meVCAH4TBu http://t.co/oRFDqmalS8
@VirginAmerica #frustrating I signed up for text alerts - nothing received. Get to LAX &amp; flight delayed 2 hours. :-(
@SouthwestAir Just flew flight 278-St Louis to Philly. A flight hostess kept bumping into my shoulder (about 5x). Never even said sorry...
Once again @united screws up flights and is inept at fixing issues they create
@united was weather. now mechanical.  Delayed 3 more hours #poordavidO #funtimesinBUR
@SSchilffarth: @united we are stuck at the gate with your contractor for W&amp;B issues.  Over 1 hour! stl@to@den. Help!
Thank you @jetblue for totally destroying my luggage tag I've had for 5 years and was immaculate and in perfect shape until I flew with you.
@AmericanAir flt 2212 (DFW - STL) has made me nvr want 2 fly AA again! Stuck on plane 2hrs to be moved to new 1. etc. extremely frustrating!
@KeithOlbermann @united glad i always leave my dog at home with caretaker. obviously united just considers pets another piece of luggage
@VirginAmerica lost my bag on a direct flight from Nj - LA... And it's nowhere to be found???? 💯 yall suck
Is this a case of 'fear of autism'? http://t.co/2VyVFf5LIU via @good Sad despicable act by @United &amp; its crew. CDC:1 in 68 children has ASD.
@SouthwestAir terrible customer service over the phone. You basically back up your employees and don't care about your customers. Screw you.
@AmericanAir BNA Admiral's Club sucks - complete disappointment. Not enuff seating. not enuff outlets for portable devices. @USAirways rocks
@AmericanAir Still waiting for an email. something not a cut and paste blah. blah...
@AlaskaAir ...shame on you @alaskaair
I just got a busy signal on @SouthwestAir customer service line. Nothing says "we don't want to help you" than that. #fail
@flyLAXairport have pity on us. Horrible cacophony greets u at 'new' @USAirways @AlaskaAir terminal 6. wall of noise from old PA fix it!!
@united you lost my husband's bag on the way to vacation (still lost 14 days later) and mine on the return.  Batting 1000 at being the worst
Really @DENAirport and @AmericanAir ?  Only one ground crew - first aa-&gt;ord flt - delayed 2hrs for 28 bags?
@AmericanAir i have a friend whose father had a medical emergency in SJD. missed their flight. they cant get ahold of cust svc pls help
@SouthwestAir Can you please tell me what it takes to speak to an actual person at phone support? Been on hold for ages.
So my @united flight is delayed   5 hours because they don’t have a plane! Only a minor issue for an AIRLINE!!! 💩✈️
I'm leaving on a jet plane quite early this am.  Miss my family already. #werkcalls Happy to be flying @VirginAmerica...
@ktmcfarland @Delta @DeltaAssist Never. ever. fly Delta. A recipe for just what you're describing. every single time.
@JetBlue I used to ONLY fly JetBlue. Now that making MORE money is more important than customer satisfaction. I'll never fly JetBlue again.
@L1LDebbie @united  shame. fire him/her then interview me for the position
This has to be a sick joke! I've been on 2 @SouthwestAir flights this wk &amp; had issues.. im fed up &amp; i still havent made it to my destination
LOL FAIL. RT @AmericanAir @DanieLee31 Our agents will work with you directly. They'll try their best to sit you and your toddler together.
@JeffreyGuterman @JasonSilva @AmericanAir Wait. isn't Haiti one of the countries the US gov warns it's citizens NOT to fly into??
I love @VirginAmerica but this safety video is brutal. What were you thinking? #myearshurt
Flying home on @AmericanAir ! Weather delay. mechanical delay. weather delay. now waiting to depart...frustrating for sure!
@katiemag4 @SouthwestAir @united  @AmericanAir never flown united. But last time on American was a fiasco. And delta has tiny planes lol
Different day. same *#&amp;! from @united Late pilots and hour+ wait to fix the a/c. they have already eaten 5 hours of my weekend on the tarmac
@SouthwestAir fuck you
@Team_Barrowman Oh that's awful. Hope you'll get a replacement xx @AlaskaAir
.@AlaskaAir plane is finally on the way so we'll board after 3 hour delay. Gate agent: "the plane is in the air. so that's the cool thing."
There's a fly on this airplane. Ugh. so lazy! @AlaskaAir
@united Delays are understandable. Lost luggage is unforgivable! Where is it? Bangladesh? Never flying United again! smh
Travel day nightmare. 3+ hour delay on @united now 3 lanes closed in the beltway.  Will take another how long to get home?
@united been waiting since February for my $150 voucher that was promised. #CustomerService #UnitedAirlines
Hi @AmericanAir me again. sitting on another delayed flight. This time fuel was put in wrong tanks in wrong amounts 😳 Delays ur thing. huh?
@JetBlue a flight cancelled because it was not longer profitable enough to operate is not something that I could have predicted.
@RaqibMarvelous @JetBlue I'm flying with them as well and I'm hearing everyone is having issues with JetBlue. Definitely not great &gt;.&gt;
@DeltaAssist our 11 am flight now might not leave until 3 Could have driven home quicker
@deja_knight One thing U will miss abt reporting: Covering stories like @SnowballExpress!  Less than 2 months!  @AmericanAir #SBE2015 #SBE15
@AmericanAir @USAirways Hi! Having trouble adding FF# to an existing U.S. Airways reservation. Been on hold for 30 min. Can you help?
Flying @AmericanAir makes me frangry (frustrated + angry). Packed in like sardines. no food. surly staff. For 6+ hours. Grrr.
@AmericanAir delayed bag. Not loaded onto plane this morn from LAW to ELP. 12 hrs+ and still waiting. This stinks. no change of clothes😯😳
.@AmericanAir #hell #airline you assholes once again delayed my flights made me sit on the Tarmac for over and hour took my tiny roller bag

@SouthwestAir was on hold for an hour just for your representative to hang up on me—ridiculous!
@shillick &amp; @WorldWarSevenCo fly the mundane skies w #BlahAirlines in terrible 6h ad for @VirginAmerica &amp; @ElevenInc http://t.co/Oc8ylJY5P7
Fuck you @AlaskaAir my flight was supposed to be over an hour ago
@United says 49 people aboard ExpressJet Flight 4580 that had to turn around and land in Milwaukee tonight.  Plane had mechanical issue.
Hey @JetBlue Why you delay my Orlando flight twice today ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) -_- xD
.@JetBlue I need to cancel flight to NYC on Feb 13 due to bad weather. Been bounced around the system. shld hv booked @SouthwestAir
This @VirginAmerica flight (769) was supposed to take off 4hrs ago. VA is one of the better airlines. Lesson: flying in 2015 sucks. Avoid.
@TheMattEspinosa SHAME ON YOU @AmericanAir FOR BREAKING THIS DINOSAURE'S BAG CAN'T BELIEVE IT
@reidspeed that's whack. but @united are the worst so..
@AmericanAir it's unbelievable how poor your service and record is. AA3162 from CVG delayed more than 2 hours.
@united broken link…fyi.
@AmericanAir booked flight but haven't received confirmation and record locator not working
@AmericanAir I can't reach @USAirways about a div miles question. They say there's bad weather &amp; hang up - can you help if I call?
@united Please help rebook me to Omaha. #371 delayed out of BWI.  Will me connecting flight. Waiting in long line. Been on hold 35 minutes.
@united so you've cancelled my friends flight to Rochester from Chicago as she's returning home from serving overseas??During the holidays??
Thanks for offering free headphones during our runway delay. @JetBlue.  (Thanks for doing all you can to get us from BOS - BUF safely. too!)
Homeward bound! Only 11 hrs 2 go. Only complaint is @united slippers not made for size 13.  #safetravels #NRT-DEN http://t.co/vKur7wgnZf
@DeltaAssist Why would my delayed bags go to another airport in Honduras that is 4 hours away.  How will I get my bags now?
Shame on @united ! RT @good: Passengers shout "leave her alone!" as United Airlines removes girl w/autism from flight http://t.co/NBSqgEyR0c
.@deltaassist sucks!!!
@united but I can't afford to go back to Heathrow and you haven't explained why I can't send it. Like I said. shitty airline
Just sitting on the plane at LAX.  Prolly gonna miss my flight to Philly. Have no clothes in my carry on. @AmericanAir
Day 4 in @united's complete failure to find and return my lost longboard.
@united I hope united airlines chokes to death on the balls it sucks. #FuckUnitedAirlines
@JetBlue Please help get us to Nationals in Orlando today!! Our flight got cancelled and we worked all year for this!!
@AmericanAir Can I get a response on the customer complaint filed ? Its been more than a week. rfrnc id 1-3017203953
@united Please get the over heated dog off the tarmac in Houston!
@united yes. but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
.@united so... We boarded a flight without a cabin crew? How does that happen? #unmannedairplane so we just wait...
@AmericanAir and to top it off. no bags once we finally got to our destination today. This is why we only use you when no other choice.
Doing it to me again @JetBlue flight delayed 2 hours FLIGHT 302 SCHEDULED 7:55 PM ESTIMATED 9:40 PM SCHEDULED 10:38 PM ESTIMATED 12:40 AM+1
@DeltaAssist @Delta is a trash airline... 2 and half hour delay. Ridiculous. Never booking with yall ever again... in life.
@AmericanAir such a concerned reply - not!  With the recent issues of #Ebola I would think that #AmericanAirlines would be more #proactive 👎
@DeltaAssist Hey! Where's our CLE ground crew? Flight 2045 stranded on tarmac.
But seriously @AmericanAir; late crew. 2 new planes. illegal pilots and endless delays...is #AA1333 ever getting to PHL? #ord2phl
.@united r u currently experiencing system wide IT issues impacting all flights? Can you let customers know the impact
@united Delayed and with a new plane. Duck tape did notake the cut to fix the plane after all. http://t.co/dYQ8pM47B8
Stuck in Dallas for the night. #NoCrew #TravelProblems @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist Hi. if you arr @ JFK T4 from AMS &amp; need to pick up a boarding pass for connecting flt to JFK. do you need to leave T4?
Never fly @AmericanAir especially if there's an emergency! Won't even refund a change of flight charge due2a death in your immediate family!
@AlaskaAir is now crazy with the "put your overhead bags in sight" security measure but i dig it.  miss my #writethedocs pals!
@united I spent over 3 hours speaking w/ agents at United. No solution. Dumped us on @AlaskaAir who went above &amp; beyond. Poor #CustServ
Really unimpressed with @Delta today. Delayed flight 1698 ATL-ORF. No communication. rude. unprofessional. @DeltaAssist #nothappy
Missing Baggage. Flight Delays. Rude workers.. Don't fly @united!    #theworst
.@united seems to be all about revenue and not customer comfort. 20 empty seats but can't move if you don't pay. #CustomerExperience #fail
@united yes- I called and held for 25 minutes before being put back on hold and then mysteriously getting cut off- what number should I call
@AmericanAir flights cancelled without notice and no #customerservice number available - limited online contact form - frustrating!
@AmericanAir do you intentionally hire rude people or do you train them that way?
Only @united can screw up a flight botch the explanation and then offer an $800 travel voucher instead of a $200 hotel voucher.
Ahh @united little help. First cancelled flight now no one knows where our bags are. #stuck #frustrating
Anyone else stuck at MSY airport? Seems like other flights going. Been on plane at gate for 3 hours w/o takeoff. @SouthwestAir @msyinfo
As I wait in line at YYZ baffled by @united booking confusion. I think of @jmspool.
.@AmericanAir Your call center has now hung up on me four times. Very frustrating. #badService
@AmericanAir @PHXSkyHarbor 1 hour before departure- be at your gate. and wait for  4 more hours untill your flight departs.
@DeltaAssist @Delta so why do you people fucking suck. Talking about messing with my life. Can't load bags now I'm sleeping in Utah vs LAðŸ’©
@AmericanAir .9/27 AA1584 TUS-DFW dprtd &gt;3hour late. only 5 pax. 1 pax tried 2 foto empty ac. FA said no because security. Was FA correct?
@united I submitted my complaint.  Will someone respond by email?
@AmericanAir I'm aware. But it still sucks for members who have been loyal customers for years but just don't fly enough to reach gold.
@AmericanAir My mother and daughter are stuck in Chi but supposed to meet me in Madrid! Help!
@AmericanAir Everything that happens at American Airlines is to benefit American Airlines. Passengers are never first. You should know that.
@united my luggage is now missing after 28 hours in transit
@AmericanAir I have filled it and and it still says nothing for the tracking. Do you think it has gone missing? 😢
Never fails @AmericanAir! In Miami delayed. deplaned 2xs due to mechanical. Safety FIRST. but crew is annoyed. agent is overwhelmed.
@united I was very upset to read one of your pilots just kicked a autistic child of a flight.he better be fired.NOT COOL.free flights I say!
@DeltaAssist This is beyond lost bag. Asked to gate check bag. flight held 3+ hrs at gate for maintenance. 15 min. to make connection (1/2)
@adamcarolla flying @AmericanAir today.which is horrible. but at least I get to watch #roadhard
Sounds like @united needs some Autism Awareness training: Family kicked off of plane due to "Fear of Autism" http://t.co/hCaVu3jlLA
C'mon @UNITED. On the phone for 25 mins. transferred over and then call ends. Really! U can do better than that. #customer #consumer #fail
@AmericanAir @TahoeMommy311 she's on her flight. agent at your counter in Reno failed to advise their flight was DELAYED not missed
Really? No! My @JetBlue flight on Tuesday was canceled &amp; rescheduled 4 today &amp; is now delayed an hour. I just want to go home.#casenais
@Peche_Eh what a blatant lie @united! No one is getting more space!! E+ lost space and so did Economy. Stop lying to your customers.
Worst service I have experienced in my life from @AmericanAir. Canceled flight. broken reservations. employees unable to work with merger
OMG-here we go again. @AmericanAir has failed back-to-back! I can't get help ANYWHERE! I can't chk in. Superv's are rude &amp; defensive AGAIN!
When @delta loses your bags three times in a row. it makes you wonder if it's time to switch to flying @united or @AmericanAir
Never flying with @JetBlue ever. feel ashamed for what you did.  Thank you @MatthewLush   #BoycottJetBlue
Was ready 2 applaud #jetblue 4 generosity of free tix. Until @JetBlue came out with all their new fees &amp; less service. Great timing. sad.
@AmericanAir how is the first flight to Chicago delayed from philly?? Epic fail 4307
@united the front desk staff was very rude at your Austin Bergstrom location. I'm sure I wouldn't have had this with @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir man yall staff fucking wack! Give ople dirty looks n shit smh..
@AmericanAir What're the odds I can talk to a live human being on the phone about an existing reservation? Been on hold now 37 minutes...
@AmericanAir waited on hold for 2 hours last night to try to rectify with no answer from AA.   Today boys leaving at 8 PM.Goodluck boys
Why doesn't this @united flight have TVs? That's the reason I pay for this airline. At least it's not a cross country flight. Oh wait it is.
Flights on LH back to USA canceled b/c of strike. It's a @united ticket but was told to call @lufthansa who don't pick up the phone. #fuck
@KeelsUS @united-Flyers need to revolt.No to excessive wait times or over booking.No other company could get away with this.why should they
Oh my God. Yo fuck @united RT @isthecolor: This needs a signal boost  https://t.co/y8sSwlf8PP
@AmericanAir flight #1445 delayed because on Hanger.....is it dry cleaning? 48 hours of cancellations and delayes! http://t.co/Q16YzLWnzJ
@xjimenez @SouthwestAir Internet speed was terrible. but I took it as a sign I should stop working. And did.
@AmericanAir I knew emailing was a waste 10 days ago so I figured Twitter is the better approach. I would like to talk to about a rebate.
Flying with @JetBlue were a disaster so far. They changed all our flights this morning. Both changed flights were delayed also!
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 2 hours and 7 minutes!!!!! #answeralready
Email from .@united said there was a delay in issuing my ticket &amp; nothing needed on my part. My ticket wasn't issued &amp; I was never notified
@AmericanAir Force me 2 check my carry on. Lose bag for 3 days + damage it. Offer me $25 for a now useless $190 bag. You guys suck.
I hope like hell @united responds to my online complaint!  You'd be remiss to let a talk show host walk away angry!
@DeltaAssist @Delta - Diamond Flyer The lack of information given to passengers waiting for Flight 2081 to Tampa over 1hr late unacceptable!
@AmericanAir this FA had no concern for my safety &amp; I even asked &amp; he didn't help.  It was dangerous &amp; pathetic. u should investigate
@DeltaAssist 8hours with no answer! You are definitely beating all expectations - glad we dont wait on you!
@united hi. i never heard back from your customer service team re: my complaint from two months ago.
Flew @americanair today. #peoplepayforthis? #masochism.  So bad I might switch to @SpiritAirlines!
I'm on a airplane that smells like armpits sweat and bad breath .. @AmericanAir
@united you really should teach your employees how to be courteous and polite. I was a fan of United but not anymore.  so rude!!!
SHAME on @AmericanAir it's the 2nd day I'm stuck in Vegas with my Family and no solution nor compensation proposed #DallasWeather
@AlaskaAir we had no control to get to the airport early and now we have to wait to check bags.  #poorservice
At Houston Hobby headed to Bay Area. Original flight to SFO delayed. Rescheduled to OAK. @SouthwestAir
@TheChainsmokers oh I feel ya. Our flight was delayed and they lost our luggage on our way to Mexico! Screw @united never again.
Never flying @united from PR again
WORST airport trip. They lost my gatecheck bag&amp;made me miss connection. Stuck here for 8 hours @dfwairport @AmericanAir #livid #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir 3478 was deplaned bc of a mechanical malfunction. we were told to wait 2hrs. set up for a backup flight to JFK. Now told (1/2)
@DeltaAssist: 3 hour delay Seattle To LAX for mechanical trouble. Landed 45 mins ago and still on Tarmac. #unhappy
Of course @united would delay my flight!
@mplotnik @DeltaAssist I had the same problem 2 months ago being a diamond medallion. #whathappenedtoloyalty
@AlaskaAir it normal for flight attendants to request to smell passengers' clear liquids? I.e.. water?
Waiting at #sat for a @united agent to help us... It's been 45 minutes and every agent has been rude. Likely won't make it to work tomorrow
AS 27  @AlaskaAir at least we have power. 2 hours and counting on Tarmac.
@AmericanAir checkin line not moving at all. Only two people working on a Saturday. Going to miss my flight. Got here 1.5 hrs early too.
@AmericanAir why have I never had an on-time flight with you?
@JetBlue what happens if the runway closure delays make me missing my connecting flight in Boston tomorrow?
My @SouthwestAir is delayed because the ground crew is having trouble counting. #SimpleMath
âœˆï¸ @united flight 1088 (SD to SF) delayed for an hour and a half+ for a faulty AC lightbulb? I like you guys @united but this one is rough.
Shocker another @United delay. Beyond ridiculous!
@DeltaAssist im on your flight 5149 and we got another 45 minute delay causing me to miss my connecting fl to cuse...what a joke!
@united I did that the first time around when requested and got no response when I DM'd details.  Had to get stuff figured out on my own.
. @AmericanAir is THE WOST airline EVER! Delayed flights. had to beg for the 1st class I PAID FOR. LOST MY BAG. I hate u guys NEVER AGAIN
@united actually left the departure gate on time this morning. only to u-turn because of a maintenance issue. Hope I make my connection 😣
@mikeschutz @DrHowieMell why does anyone fly @United??!!?? Worst. Airline. Ever.
@DeltaAssist do your employees know how to spell courtesy? Delta has the most non-courteous staff. Very bad experience at ORD. #DeltaSucks
I've been waiting for a gate at DCA longer than my flight from JFK took. Get your shit together @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir just de-boarded an @united flight not sure why I decided to give United a chance. I won't leave you again.
â€œ@HoodieAllen: FUCK YOU DELTA FUCK ALL MY LOYALTY TO YOU. FOR NOTHING. FUCK YOU @Delta @DeltaAssistâ€ @jaydendeann
Shame on you @united for not waving baggage fees for those going to help in #Napoli your a prime example of American greed.
@united I am disappointed in the horrible self check in. staff with no personalities. stupid lines by group and the sucky wifi.
Having issues yet again using my @americanair voucher - I swear at this rate I’ll never give up my seat again! This is ridiculous #help
So far loving @VirginAmerica compared to @united. Shame they don’t have more locations :P
@united I'm flying UA3564 to EWR. So unhappy to share ur  steward behavior. He holder up 65 passenger to board just to ask 5 first class
@VDeadd @cyanide600 @OBMGKyle @DeltaAssist YOU'RE GONNA RECREATE 9/11 WHAT THE FUCK @BarackObama  @JESUS @FBI @CIA
@AmericanAir -So disappointed!  Couldn't check in online. ticket machine broke and no one at counter so no way to get boarding pass 😳
@TheBabyGuyNYC Jamie. if you fly @JetBlue to long beach. I can totes pick you up. My bro and I have had bad luck w/@AmericanAir all year.
@AmericanAir your customer service is awful. It says expected wait is 25 min. 1 hour later I still haven't spoken to anyone.
@united you should be ashamed. you had a plane full of angry people and a crew that openly said they were embarrassed to work for @united
@SouthwestAir still on hold. This is ridiculous...
Way to go @JetBlue NOT! My 6'4" husband books 2 months ago and gets a middle seat. A lady walks up one minute ago and gets an aisle. BAD!

@JacobWhitesides @AmericanAir ??? IS IT AMERICAN AIRLINES BC THEY BAD
10 / In the next chapter of @AlaskaAir #EpicFail Flight 76. they failed to check my luggage thru to my final destination. So now we wait...
@tntradioempire @SouthwestAir Delayed - No plane Todd
Disappointed in @JetBlue. Increasing seats from 150 to 165 is horrible; among other things. http://t.co/reApj5ug55
@AmericanAir @USAirways 15.000 miles not enough #poorservice #7hourflightdelay #midflightmechanicalissue #neverlfiyUSAirways #worsttripever
@vmiss33 that's agood reason to no longer fly @united
@united I have had it!!! So rude!!! Just shlepped my bag all the way from international and this woman yelled at me
Do yourself a favor. never fly @USAirways @AmericanAir HORRIBLE service
@united ur customer service team offers NOTHING for 5 1/2 hr mechanical delay that got me stuck in Houston overnight #Airlines
@JetBlue thanks to the not so reliable app. and gate changes.. We just missed our flight.. Getting home soo late!
@peoplemag @united Unacceptable!
@AmericanAir is it ok for restroom to be unlit &amp; a flight attendant to tell passengers if they fall in the blue poop juice it's their fault?
@SouthwestAir That moment when the flight is delayed longer than the actual flight time.
@AmericanAir has the WORST customer service! As a platinum member. they didn't follow up on an online ... http://t.co/1tE4og82CN
@united We have been sitting on the tarmac for over an hour now in Denver. The air isn't even on and this plane is HOT. SO NOT OK.
@united baggage sets records there  MT @geoffschwartz: @JosinaAnderson EWR puts part tm in2 everyt'g. This terml bad. Terrible food options.
Always delayed @AmericanAir #goodwork
@AmericanAir may daughter finally got home last eve. flight was delayed 20 mins because of overbooking. Airline is the worst ever!
Sigh. my only reason to fly @JetBlue. no bag fees &amp; leg space. are going down the toilet. http://t.co/m4ve4Nc0AP  Thanks for nothin. guys
Total shitshow at #MIA with @AmericanAir. Wait in line to check in on frozen kiosks. Wait in line to drop checked bags. Wait. Flawed system
Broken 1st class seat 2C on UA3913 @united
@DeltaAssist I just boarded the plane to Midway and saw this. Should I be concerned my bag is lost? http://t.co/DNvmdKCElc
@united years of using united and yesterday was the worst customer service ever Pls get our bags to Honolulu on the only flight from newark!
@AmericanAir too have the worst customer service I have ever see!!!!
@united two days later and still no response?
The plane we're supposed to get on isn't even HERE yet this thing's not gonna leave at 9 honestly do better @God @fly2ohare @united
@AmericanAir A wounded Marine should be able to hang his dress blues without a problem. First class or not. Bad form AA @genesimmons
@SouthwestAir Sure wish I was flying SWA. At least with mechanical delays of 7 hours. you provide vouchers on the spot! Not so with DeltaðŸ˜
#shame on you @united Piloto echa a familia de 1 aviÃ³n porque lo "incomodaba" 1 adolescente autista http://t.co/ssHuANt223 via @lanacioncom
How the HECK is a 38 minute layover possible at SFO. @united?  Is that even a legal routing?
Come on @united get it together! Always a delay. This is why I fly delta 95% of the time.
. @VirginAmerica boarding process and terminal at EWR is chaos and a mess. You guys really need to clean this up.
@bilbo_fraggins worst flying experience with @JetBlue. Including a pilot that made passengers think we would run out of fuel mid-flight.
Itâ€™s unbelievable how often @united runs my travel. Another delay. another lost connection. Stranded as usual.
@DeltaAssist response from them is pathetic. talked w/ 3 agents. put me on hold for 20 mins and tell me diff rules each time. @KLM @Delta
Unfortunate two hour delay @VirginAmerica. All the more reason to switch airlines so I can at enjoy that centurion lounge
After another hour on the tarmac with the kids. next logical step is cancel the flight and return to the terminal.   Wait. No. Why @united?
On the flight to DC. Once again @AirTran fucked me over. But @SouthwestAir recovered....barely
@AmericanAir @ucs_dave Could be worse. could be crammed into an A319 in the less comfortable seats.
.@united. you just refused my refund-request for delaying my bag &amp; not delivering it to me.  Could you please revisit request #18302029?
@AmericanAir didn't have my cousins reserved gluten-free meal on two consecutive cross-country flights #FirstClass #Disappointed
Seriously. @VirginAmerica. every time I look at your new site I consider switching airlines.  So awful.
Got off work early. rushed 2 airport @SouthwestAir wouldn't let me get earlier flight w/out $300. Manager was rude on Xmas. dismissed me
@kristen @united Women should never be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding. #healthyhappybabies
.@jetblue please ask them to hold flight 661 to Barbados!  We were late because of the outage and it's our wedding. PLEASE
@united it seems that you have quite a few of unhappy customers. Word of mouth is very bad for a airline.
@VirginAmerica Your site has been jammed and making me reselect things over and over for almost 15 minutes.  Now I'm missing the FOMO sale.
It's funny how when flights are delayed and airlines are shitty and provide bad service people bond...I'm looking at you @AmericanAir
Horrible @united flights. Lavs break for 5 hours on 893 so they stop serving food&amp;bev. then mtn. delay on 892 will cause missed connection
Never taking @AmtrakNEC again from Boston. @BoltBus or @jetblue only. since at least they have policies in place for four hour delays.
@VirginAmerica attempting to take advantage of your sale fares but the website keeps getting stuck! Tried multiple devices.
@Sia wtf is this shit @united
@United having major issues with a redemption booking.Agents wont look up/dont understand rule and I've been "disconnected" 5 times pls help
Crazy day @AmericanAir  Because of delays out of MIA. #LaFeriaDeLaFamilia guests never made it to Providence due to missed connection #boo
@united shame on U 4 not granting a full refund because I'm 9 months pregnant and cannot fly U may want to update your T&amp;Cs #discrimation
@AmericanAir been waiting 3 weeks for a response to my very specific email to @USAirways about an awful experience #terriblecustomerservice
Been at the airport for 7 hours. cause @AmericanAir delayed our flight for 11 hrs. Doubt we're gonna make it to LA for the start of the tour
Still never got my bag @united - been stuck in Europe w/ nothing...anyone gonna actually contact me?
@united waiting on your plane at yyc airport for an hour with no updates to your customers. Never flying united again
@SouthwestAir - whyyyyy is the flight from BUR to PHX delayed so long???? @mezara wonders why people still fly #southworst
@shawnad33 @SouthwestAir Oh my goodness I have had the WORST time with them lately!!  ðŸ˜ ðŸ‘Š
I will avoid flying @AmericanAir anymore. Worst flight delays and customer service I have ever had.
Worst flight two weekends in a row. @AmericanAir #americanairlines
Whoever issues the ticket is responsible for changes. In this case it's @travelocity. I wouldn't blame @JetBlue.  /cc @sej @vainpresumption
@DeltaAssist Stuck in TPA on way to ATL-need 6 to FNT today. Any options?
@AmericanAir flight 49 has been on the ground 40 minutes in DFW. and you still haven't unloaded luggage.  Unacceptable.
@JetBlue @Boston_Calling IM POOR AND IVE NEVER BEEN TO A CONCERT EVER PLEASE #JetBlueWillCall
@SouthwestAir I have a question regarding my "late checked" baggage. Can I DM you guys?
@DeltaAssist what the beat way to reach you guys ... I was waiting for 10 min to talk to your representative reg my delta sky miles account
@JetBlue how about you don't cancel my friends flight leaving from JFK for my wedding? Pretty please with sugar on top. #GetWorse @dbot23
Never EVER ðŸ’˜ RT @raymcalmont: I would never cheat on @JetBlue â¤ï¸ðŸ™.
Thanks @JetBlue for delaying my flight and then having the flight scheduled to leave an hour after mine depart first.
.@AmericanAir Did your pilots go missing too? The (awesome) stewardesses are frantically looking for the most important guys on the flight.
Does @united need help hiring new staff? Flight attendants were late in Lagos (LOS). and they "can't find a crew" in Houston (IAH)! _
@AlaskaAir were you getting complaints from first class or is this change expected to expedite the boarding process?
7 hours of @AmericanAir inefficiency @ Medellín Int'l and now I won't be back in KY till late tomorrow night. #happythoughts #happythoughts
@DeltaAssist due to delays in ATL missed my connecting flight to SDF. Can you help?
@AmericanAir loses husband's luggage. ruins hunting trip. says can't refund baggage fees! Any attorneys out there?
@jarpad @AmericanAir OH SHIT
I know that problem.  Been stuck at a hub (IAD) for too long myself.  But no more @united. @MarkinCHS @VirginAmerica @ARdpb
@AmericanAir  it's 547am &amp; im @ the airport waiting for a departure at 1040. Y? B/c u didnt  inform me that the flight had been cancelled .
Held reservation on @AmericanAir . Agent tells me that no seats available despite booking. Website shows 'on hold till Jan 3' (1/2)
@DeltaAssist can you let me know what the situation with flight 5287 tomorrow?  Arrival is delayed 4 hrs but not the departure.
@JetBlue LOVES cancelling flights!! Get me home to NY please!!
@SouthwestAir How long is the usual wait to get through customer service?
@SouthwestAir I have been on hold for 23 mins &amp; counting waiting to talk w/custservice. W/bad music &amp; promises call will be answered shortly
“@DeltaAssist: @dotmariejones Oh no. What's going on? *MR” WHATS WRONG IS DELTA SCREWED UP THE SEATS WE HAD AND NOW WONT GET THEM BACK!
@united this seems evil http://t.co/DN7ewbhe2S
$200+ change fees? You'd think @USAirways would be in 21st century now and on par with @SouthwestAir or @JetBlue ! Guess not! #poorservice
And would it kill @united to have the same seasons of House of Cards amongst the IFE variants!? #firstworldproblems
@AmericanAir fail #1!  I'm stuck away from home b/c I couldn't check in online. The website was down. #AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir Gave me a voucher for a night at a hotel in ATL due to flight issues last weekend. Hotel has now charged me for room. Help!
@JetBlue over an hour on the Tarmac with no word from the pilot on the status of leaving or any offer for water... #unsatisfiedcustomer
@united stuck on the tarmac at LGA flight 299 to ORD. Going to miss connection to MCI at 12:08. What's next flight I &amp; @ryanngro can get on?
My flight w @united is delayed AGAIN. and I'm out of my cold medicine. I want the CEO to bring me some coricidin cold and flu. immediately.
@united #UA5105 complete terrible flight to #cmh First told delay was ATC. then no pilot. then no crew. then mechanical. 6 hour delay unfair
@AmericanAir Please hold flight 1465! Connecting flight from Pensacola is delayed but we're almost off the plane. #desperate
@AmericanAir delayed flight AA922. Lost connection to DCA. Oldest plane I have ever flown. Are you going vintage or sth?
@aroetter @united yup still here. At sfo. Waiting for another delayed flight.
@JetBlue you sold my ticket to someone else 45 minutes before my flight and you made me give you 50 more $$. Why did you do that #bad
@JustinNFJK @AmericanAir I hope they'll let you fly with the first plane that land. bc you have waited way tooo long!
Could you repeat the safety instructions @united ? I couldn't hear them over the smell of engine exhaust in the cabin.....
Pretty disappointed with @JetBlue starting to charge for bags in 2015. I loved the free 1st bag. TV and excellent service. #NeedToPackBetter
@Delta @DeltaAssist you have HUNDREDS of Frustrated Ticket holders stuck in a airport with only 3 ticket agents to help! Frustrating
Shoutout to @DeltaAssist @Delta for my 2 hours and counting delay. chilling in ATL for now
@deltaassist supposed to fly out of fort Walton beach through ATL to FLL but telling me delayed. but doesn't say how long. Make connecting?
@bvkcitizen That's clearly poor service. but just so you know @united does not hire Skycaps. That's a seperate service run by the airport.
@JetBlue Ticket agent switched my family member's seat. Customer svc didnt have record of the switched seat when I inquired. Very fishy.
Agh so frustrating! Saw the perfect @JetBlue flight and now its goooneee. #florida #nyc #october
@Scottmeyer @DeltaAssist @Gogo I've been experience the same issue on multiple flights!
@AmericanAir G'day. having issues wth a transport voucher I'm trying to redeem for a flight on Thurs. I mailed to FL a month ago yet not 1/2
@united has to be the worst airline ever!!!
.@AmericanAir update: they canceled my seat booking. promised to put me on standby. then did NOT put me on standby. Paid $500 for no flight
@SouthwestAir only airline with a huge line in Omaha. Why aren't you prioritizing the line by flight time? Many are going to miss flights
One problem after the next...major mechanical problem on my @SouthwestAir plane causing huge delay.
@JetBlue Your flight was late and u guys didn't hold my connecting flight and I get put on stand by. What kind of messed up service is that?
@SouthwestAir can you tell me why flight 1473 has not left Chicago yet?The staff hasn't told us anything &amp; we've been waiting nearly an hour
@AmericanAir You lost my Dad's luggage in a flight from DFW to MCO 10 days ago and not a word from you about it.He has to bought new clothes
Already being reminded of all the reasons I never fly @AmericanAir . Flipping nightmare
@dr_pete @united dude that stinks. sorry :( I hope they do something more to make it up to you. but unfortunately I'd be surprised :(
@JetBlue this company sucks. Paid 3x price of husband's seat for my mom to sit in his seats!!!!! #jetblueSucks #jetblue
@United 1 lax club closed. 1 full. No customer service.
@SouthwestAir you cancelled my flight and now I've been on hold for over 30 mins. Just want to get home today 😰
@united I am on the phone trying to get a flight changed and the employee is so rude. There is a discrepancy btw price hes saying vs online
10 reasons NEVER to fly @united domestic 1) flight staff cannot manage bags on planes. so those in the back lose thier bags #StowingSux
@DeltaAssist can you please ask the stewardess to close the first class curtain on DL240? Lots of screaming children and lavatory thieves.
@AmericanAir Canceling my flight is a dirty trick after rebooking me on a red-eye. I'll now arrive home 12 hours late.
@AmericanAir I've been on the phone 40 mins &amp; counting. just trying to book a flight. 1st time I got hung up on. now I've been on hold 4ever
@united You have lost my business. Concerning military and veterans. your company has clear integrity issues &amp; your policies lack veracity.
@AmericanAir baggage delayed flying from miami to newark last night. still not located. no service agents answering phones. please help
@united I reschedule a ticket. y am I getting charged full price  as if I'm buying a new ticket when I paid $100 to put on hold
Really @AmericanAir? Flight cancelled. no notification. I call &amp; am told call volume high &amp; to call back later? How am I going to get home??
@DeltaAssist @Delta File submitted. 4 weeks? really? I mean........ REALLY? I guess I'll wait. #slowcustomerservice http://t.co/jmxJYoVm1T
@DeltaAssist 60-90 minute wait to talk to someone on the phone is RIDICULOUS.
@AmericanAir flight 2245 delayed!  I just want to be home...
@NobodyEpic @KYR_SP33DY  @DeltaAssist  what the hell Delta
2 months ago flew @jetblue to West Palm 3 hour delay. Today flying @jetblue to West Palm AGAIN a three hour delay. WTF?!
@AmericanAir guarantees customer refund. says just to go online after trip. It's a lie. just so they don't have to deal with angry....
@AmericanAir I will never fly with Yall again. horrible. gave 24 flights away. that was ours
@jen_desouza Oh no! So sad to hear that @united isn't taking care of their customers!
Not the entire fleet @united. it's the terrible CRJ200s that are missing the  #FriendlySkies mark.
@AlaskaAir epic fail on updating us on a twice moved twice delayed flight...your App gave me the wrong terminal and gate...
@JaniceWhaley  Can't be any worse than the vegan option ("Vegtable vegitarian") on @AmericanAir we were tortured with recently #foodcrime
@AmericanAir Any way to get a waiver on a ticket change?  I just want to leave a day later.  The $200 is just too much.
@AmericanAir my stroller got broken on my flight Tuesday  night from nyc to fll
@DeltaAssist @Delta Picture of tray table AFTER I cleaned it myself. #gross #racetothebottom #dobetter #fail http://t.co/FYwDytpGFo
@LMPinDC Remember that time @united lost my bag/Christmas presents on a gate check for TWO WEEKS?
@DeltaAssist 2+ hours sitting at LGA waiting to deplane?  This is ridiculous.
I am sad @united changed our flight itinerary. Now we either have to pay extra to get a later flight. or lose a day of vacation. :(
@AmericanAir on hold with customer service for 30+minutes after flight cancelled with only a 2 hour notification before flight. What gives?
@VirginAmerica is your Elevate site broken? Seems like.
Wouldn't be an @AmericanAir flight if it didn't get delayed. #TiredOfThis
Will @USAirways Flight 894 leave #CLT tonight? Scheduled departure 8:20pm. crew "landed" at 8:30pm. Now 9:40pm. Cockpit empty @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir my gf has been delayed 31 hours at DIA and now has been delay 3 hours in KCI this is fucked up how can she get compensation?
@idigdata @AmericanAir what happened? We've never had issues with them.
Now that I'm gold on @united they seem to forget the priority luggage tags half the time and I never seem to get my paid-with miles upgrades
@Delta @DeltaAssist please hold our Sydney flight DL0417 in LAX.Biohazard on ATL flight delayed us. 20 of us don't want to lose a day in SYD
@united Just an awful flight from JFK-LAX last night. $33.95 to use the internet. exit row seats with less room than any other seats.
@DeltaAssist making a bad day even worse! How long does it take to get a plane from JFK to LGA? So far 4 hrs. #deltafail
@VirginAmerica had to watch MSNBC for 4 hours because that was the only channel available. now stuck on runway after landing. Help!
@AirCanada you booked us on a flight to New Orleans from Ottawa with @united - they have no booking. We're stranded and screwed. Please Help
Still waiting at the airport. Past departure time. Still hoping to be able to sing on the show. No update on anything from @AmericanAir
@JetBlue why did you get rid of the refund to your travel bank when the fare dropped below your purchase price? #notcool
Just got off the phone with an @AmericanAir customer service rep trying to change a flight..I've never felt like such a nuisance in my life.
@united still waiting on a payment that you fuckwits promised me 3weeks ago. '5-7 days' according to Rosie Memari #useless #clueless #awful
I kinda miss the days when @AmericanAir boarded the plan in reverse seat order. I feel like there were less lines then. #waitingwaiting
@VirginAmerica Just inconsistent answers.  Illegal routing. none for sale. and also that the flights don't exist.  None true.
@cregeta12 @united United's response delayed like their flights? Help Nepal and Nepalese get relief supplies soon please!
@united I am so frustrated with your airline...I could scream. -____-
Been on hold for 1hr 15 minutes &amp; counting with @AmericanAir Winter wx cancelling flights all over.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE WHOLE US @united
Amazing how @VirginAmerica and @JetBlue fly identical planes yet the Virgin experience is great &amp; Jetblue fucking sucks.
@JetBlue ah man!  2 hour delay flight 164 and then no flyfi?!  Come on now....
Oh no! @Delta @DeltaAssist Flight DL3777 delayed 30 min.  Now only 27 min to cross MSP AP with infant. fill bottles. and change diaper.
HILARIOUS. After a horrendous 3 days with @AmericanAir. the complaint section on their website doesn't let you type. http://t.co/pAxYalZYHa
Wonder how long itll take someone from @AmericanAir to get back to me. If it's anything like my recent experience. probably never #TheWorst
Never flying @SouthwestAir again out of SFO. #alwaysdelayed
@ChrisSnider @AmericanAir I know the feeling I had 5 hour delay 2 broken planes and they took 360.000 miles for the trip #americanAirlines
@AmericanAir Issues with the mobile app? Keep getting a "Server Not Responding" error and can't view any reservations!
@kalpenn @AmericanAir how about not being a cheap fuck and paying the $25 bag fee?
@AmericanAir hate to ask. but WHY am I on a janky old plane JFK-LAX?? What happened to new planes coast to coast?!
@DeltaAssist When both flights get cancelled. stuck in Atlanta for 13 hours and going and you lose his luggage! #DeltaAirline #Worst
waiting in line at airport b/c @jetblue cancelled my flight. line hasn't moved. wtf is taking so long? probably an archaic booking system
@AmericanAir What the hell happened with flight 5742 from BHM to DFW?! My boyfriend is on the flight &amp; he's okay. but his phone battery died
Looks like the only way to contact @united is by tweeting them. No customer service. What a joke. Sorry sacks of shit
@jordanmike @SouthwestAir Shit. It happens.
I will never fly @AmericanAir out of #Miami again. If service were any slower Id think think the airport was closed.
@DeltaAssist what's frustrating is at 7a y'all cancelled the 1 and 3 flights from DFW to ATL. I'm sitting on AA's 1p flt no probs.
Made it back to PHX 25 minutes ahead of schedule. @SouthwestAir I'll never leave you.
@united no expedited boarding for families travelling with infants? Clearly not a family-friendly airline! #badairline #unitedairlines
.@united Flight just delayed 7 hours. Will obviously miss connection. When are you sending my revised itinerary?
@BenBrucato @DeltaAssist @Delta I know they canceled my bfs flight bc of bad weather in NY. I'm here! No bad weather! Lol they're terrible
@united @NY_NJairports explain why baggage claim takes 45 minutes since landing ???!!! Frustrated
@BillyHolguin delayed again @JetBlue never flying on this airline again
Delayed Flights✅Missing Baggage✅Poor customer support✅"The American Way"❌ Learn from @DeltaAssist because @AmericanAir  has lots to learn
Flight cancelled from #SeaTac to Spokane great time of the year for mechanical issues @AlaskaAir #holidayseason #stranded
2 hours on a tarmac? I love you @VirginAmerica but not this much #VX346 #NotNeededAfterFinals
@FrinkFilms my bag went missing 5 months ago and they still haven't reimbursed me @united
@jetblue Denying someone access because of their tweets? I thought you were a crappy airline not a regime! @westjet learn from their mistake
@SarahBlackwood1 that is crazy! So @united throws you off a plane and @delta is ordering pizza for passengers on a delayed flight. Go @delta
@HEELZiggler @united ðŸ˜‚ Dammit Ziggles! You had one fucking thing to do!!
@SouthwestAir paid for in flight Wi-Fi. couldn't post this until we landed and I had cell service again #fail
. @united f*cking up per usual. "we got you here 2 hours late. &amp; you get bonus of waiting for an hour. Next up. no one to attach the gate!
@JetBlue frustrated that there isn't  correct updated information about our delay totally understand the delays but not the lack of info!
@americanair what's with no wifi on regional flights?  You're behind the times and my productivity has gone to 0. Please join the modern age
@SouthwestAir The flight attendants were terrible from KCI to Chi I've never been addressed so many times on 1 flight in all the flyin we do
@SarahBlackwood1 @united kicks a pregnant woman and her child off a plane???? Sickening
@AmericanAir-wish he'd handled my problems at LAX last November. or that someone would contact me regarding my complaint #stillwaiting
@yvette_whitesid @elegantfarmertn it was DELISH! Still waiting on my bag @united.
@AmericanAir how many emails and information do you guys need? Do you not have a database? #horribleservice
Got to board early for having the @VirginAmerica credit card! Never had that happen before. Love you. VA ❤️
Returning to SFO in middle of final approach to MRY on @united 5503. Fog-landing equipment turned off today. Huge waste of everyone's time.
Come on @JetBlue announce my gate bc this is ridiculous at laguardia (can't go through security until your gate is announced)
.@united Xmas flights changed to awful times and added connections and even more ridiculous customer service. Wish we had gone with @JetBlue
@AmericanAir in laws stuck in phl. Flight canceled. 200 people in line to rebook. What can you do?
@JetBlue you need to have a chat function on your website to avoid long wait times
@AmericanAir really sucks!
Not good @JetBlue http://t.co/VgVwWYIhjR
@AmericanAir why do you keep saying that there are no flights from NYC to FPO when I am looking at tons of available flights?
@united weird after my terrible experience booking the flight. my flight took off over an hour late &amp; I missed my connecting
@chigirldc @AmericanAir you can claim for your delayed flight. Check to see if youâ€™re entitled to compensation- http://t.co/gspPqp8Diu
@SouthwestAir Delayed my 1st flight but did not delay my connecting. Landing five minutes after my second flight takes off. I hate them.
Not to do the cliche airline complaint tweet. but @AmericanAir. you are truly the red headed stepchild of airlines. #clicheairlinetweet #ugh
@united Delayed. Missed connection. Lines! No one working! No hotel voucher?! #poorcustomerservice #UA1088 http://t.co/fgQS1EDaz6

@OJessicaNigri @SouthwestAir they better pay for that! That's unacceptable shit
@SouthwestAir Flight canceled. No email from anyone. Been on hold for ten mins. Flight #805 and #2780
Complaint has been submitted to @JetBlue. Let's count how many days until "someone contacts me".....  Today is Day 1 http://t.co/EeZifh0x0d
Had the worst service ever on @VirginAmerica on the way back from NY this past weekend. Just emailed my concern. Prolly won't hear back 😡😥
If @united is upset with services like @Skiplagged. it should implement less-idiotic flight pricing.
@TheScottRider @united amen rider.  United sucks
@AmericanAir delayed getting off flight?Pregnant? Late for connector? "We won't wait for you." No golf cart either. Luckily I can still run.
My husband &amp; I are getting different flight delay notifications @united. but  attendants or premier agents don't seem to know about any
On my @alaskaair flight from Boise and praying Duke wins while I'm in flight! No wifi so maybe a pilot update?
@phoneman07 @SouthwestAir never plan a vacation on mode of transportation unless YOU control the mode getting there #ThatSucks #NoBagFees
@AmericanAir u never cease to disappoint.  Another epic failure!  #epicfailure
@americanair I am at NAS gate c58 waiting for a 4:04 pm flt.  No staff here.  Scarf left at security. Twisted ankle.  Can't walk.  Plz help?
Headed IAD-ATL-MLB on @Delta to see nationâ€™s top Autism specialist for my grandson. @DeltaAssist had cancelled all seats for family of 4.
@JetBlue One day later. no response on my mom's lost bag. No return phone call. no information on your website. What gives?!?
Another day and still no news or update from @USAirways @AmericanAir #lostluggage #badservice
@VirginAmerica this is the worst flight experience ever! I've been delayed 6 hours and gone to 10 gates! I'm gonna miss my first day of work
@AmericanAir when u cancel a flight. why not allow online cancellations/refunds of itinerary #onholdforever #neverflyamerican
Massive #fail for @USAirways - @AmericanAir fuel screw up.  Sitting on a plane and going no where due to method of recording fuel.
@united I have an email receipt for two gift certificates that were never delivered....who should I speak with...can you help?
Why Airlines Want to Make You Suffer http://t.co/LWVFQ3yDIX this is why I no longer fly @JetBlue
. @JetBlue you suck. Selling "even more space" seats with broken TV monitors. Thank you for 5.5 hours on boredom. Flight B6 578 seat 4F
. @united By far the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I just wanted to change my flight. NOT CANCEL ALL OF THEM.
.@AlaskaAir got that serious twitter game. Shout out to boarding from the back and emotional damage. And Michael. *air horn*
So sad that the @united app doesn't support international credit cards! I just hope to succeed when trying on the desktop version 
@united You charged me $200 to return my miles to switch flights?! I have been thinking about switching to @SouthwestAir It may be time.
Getting refused to get re-seated by @united . The guy next to me SMELLS LIKE TABACCO! and I'm noshes ! ...
Very disappointed with @JetBlue tonight. Flight 2202 to #Buffalo is 2 hours delayed and we are still sitting at the gate.
@VirginAmerica It's cyber monday and you have a huge deal - didn't you anticipate a lot of web traffic? #slow #websitefail
@AmericanAir Just got to SFO. flight was late. so I missed my connection. Can't find anyone to help me get a new flight. Help?
Horrible experience flying with @AmericanAir today from DFW-TO.not being able to check in online&amp;massive delays getting to TO #epicfail
@USAirways Two delayed flights bc "maintenance". Missed connection. Now stuck in PHX for 5 hrs. Regretting that @AmericanAir  credit card.
@oldpicsarchive Airlines are flying cattle cars now... @united #FAIL
@southwestair you cancelled flt 744 on 5/27 for weather. No rain in nwk at that time. no other airlines did this. You're liars. it seems
7 weeks now @AmericanAir since u took advantage of customers during a medical emergency&amp; refuse to respond to their request. #Pathetic
Entire plane de boarded due to maintenance issue. One @united employee trying to rebook whole plane. 10 mins later still on first person...
Had ticket Q. call @united -Rep annoyed/attitude to ME that HE couldn't hear conf # 1)look up account 2)even their status service is awful
5 hour flight no internet no movies cramped middle seat delayed on Tarmac for one hour because @united. http://t.co/KUnodzWTd1
what going on...3+ hour delay c'mon @VirginAmerica
ahh. my first trip on @SouthwestAir is also my last.  Delay to Baltimore from Cleveland. and now sitting on the tarmac for 30 min IN Balt.
Oh you have got to be kidding me @AmericanAir ! 2nd flight change and more maintenance "issues" 😑➡️😠
@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been canceled. what should i do?
75% of all @united flights I've booked have either been significantly delayed or canceled. Guess we're spending more time in Vegas. =(
@AlaskaAir you should really address two poor operations! The check in at SLC is poorly designed-- and causes unnecessary delays
@united @imstayingcloudy so you reply to people w/ late flights but when an employee steals a customers valuable its all silent on ur end 😒
@SouthwestAir checked 2 bags LAX-MDWY only have 1. Lost bag has Rx meds needed ASAP. This is unacceptable #unhappy
.@Delta you're killing me on the flight delays. Miss you @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist I was cutting it close to DL4691 after TSA delay but arrived 11 mins pre departure; GA had already closed doors &amp; left. :( :(
I don’t know why. but flight attendants never seem to like me. Today’s bitchy attitude is brought to you by. @AmericanAir. Ugh!
@AmericanAir ruining my honeymoon #lostluggage #horriblecustomerservice #flydelta
@EDMSHIT @SouthwestAir @las_degas Yeah but this is a major fuck up on their part and I doubt they want to have to deal with it lol
Hey @SouthwestAir flight 1161 bags at DAL are taking longer to come up at claim than flight time itself. Uncle.
Hey @jetblue ... Communication on what gate or hell anything would be nice. A gate attendant would be a bonus as well
@AmericanAir been on hold with your reservations department for 1 hour 45mins and counting! This is unacceptable!
@DeltaAssist: 1156 delayed out of PDX; likely missing connection in ATL. Can you get me on 4914 to CHO?
@AmericanAir Hi! How many people work the reservation phones on Sunday? When is a better time to call? I gave up after 15 mins on hold.
@United If my EWR-DCA leg is cancelled tonight and everything is full tomorrow. can you make any arrangements for a train?
My biz partner flew into #ICT on @Delta. you lost his bag. then a day later you find it &amp; treat him like its his fault. #FAIL @DeltaAssist
About missed my @AmericanAir flight because the attendant wouldnt check my bag because she was busy talking about home goods for 20 min 
Paid $8 for slowest WIFI ever.  Wonâ€™t even load Gmail.  Why even bother. @SouthwestAir?
@united disgusting! #unitedfortahera http://t.co/OR4YvD4Tot
@DeltaAssist Of the 30ish flights I've been in this year. only 1 has not been delayed.
Why does @JetBlue want to ruin the awesome things that differentiate them from the competition? It looks like I have to find a new airline!
And now the flights are delayed and no updates. Boo @united  Such poor service.
@VirginAmerica will never fly your airline again. Extremely disappointed in your policies and customer service managers.
@SouthwestAir Delta really messed it up. Any way you can get me to Fort Lauderdale in a way that doesn't require being insanely miserable?
@Delta @DeltaAssist I've contacted you all and have gotten zero assistance for issue. Can I get a number to actually talk to a human?
Hey @AmericanAir. just landed in ord. My connection on flight aa 2340 leaves in 15 mins. Don't let the plane leave without me!
@AmericanAir im really hoping that the FF programs merge soon. It sucks that a US person doesn't even get the chance to use upgrade list
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@united new slogan should be. United. sorry for the delay!  I have never had a flight on time with this company #joke #late #always
Delayed at @flystl on @southwestair 1604 ....
Hey .@AmericanAir. Still stuck in STL. What gives?
@AmericanAir i still without my luggage this is a issue  from your crew the only answer i have call back in twoo hour . im a sad freq flyer
@SouthwestAir Can't put my PRE-TSA number in online? You guys called me back 39 min later then put me on hold? I just want to add the #'s
@DeltaAssist Any chance you would put a direct flight AUS to LAS? It's only @SouthwestAir now and they are the worst! Austin needs you!
@JetBlue how can you cancel our teams flight to Orlando !! We're literally crying right now 😭😭
As much as I travel. problems are bound to happen but @AlaskaAir always has my back. It's why #iflyalaska Proud they are my customer too
Pain is an hour flight delay. and then being told that you have to camp out on the runway because your gate is occupied @DeltaAssist #DL447
@AmericanAir @aairwaves officially the WORST airline. Lost a day off our vacation and God knows when we will receive our luggage.WORST EVER
@n3benson @AmericanAir That was probably the worst merger idea. USAir will ruin AA as United ruined Continental.
Yet another terrible flying experience w @AmericanAir. Don't understand why the staff has to be so unfriendly. #nomoreAA
@SouthwestAir Gate checked our BOB stroller in La Guardia and it arrived in Dallas broken. A List Preferred. Now saying it is not covered!!
Cancelled flight. rain. blue. red. and yellow âœˆ @SouthwestAir @Fly_Nashville http://t.co/pHeWo7CYx8
@JetBlue it would help if the the customer service people would not seem like they are angry all of the time and likewise for the personnel.
@SouthwestAir I still haven't heard back from anyone and my bag has been missing for two days now. Please help?
@AmericanAir Took my money for G1boarding. took me through seat assignment. then "couldn't process my check-in". Terrible customer service
The plane is at the gate and the passengers are lining up. Taking bets on what @united reason for delaying departure will be @BIGHUB1
Just had THE absolute WORST in flight experience with @united. Never again!
So it looks like @AmericanAir lost not just my bag. but ALL the bags from my flight. ___
Hey @united GIVE @sammywilk HIS LUGGAGE NOW YOU SUCK
Been up all nite waiting 4 stupid @united 2 deliver my delayed luggage. They use a 3rd party w no phone# or real updates. #nightmare #suck
“@Sia: United airlines leaves dog on rainy cold runway for half an hour despite alerts!  SHAME ON YOU! http://t.co/4UrR9zt3Oq” @united
Never flying @JetBlue again Screw up my return location swear and hang up on me make me check carryon thats well within spec #badservice
@Jchawes @united that's insane
@MatthewLush @JetBlue WTF?! That's insane!
@AmericanAir y'all are dumb as fuck
1 more bad cust service experience w/ @united &amp; I'm status matching to @delta. I predict it happens on my next flight (Mon)
@americanair hi. i have a "multi-city" itinerary. first flight is delayed so will miss connection. will it rebook automatically?
Awww fuck. mechanical delay in Austin means getting switched to ANOTHER flight on @SouthwestAir from SAN &gt; LAS. Not gonna land until 3:45pm!
@AmericanAir I've been waiting for 35 minutes waiting to talk to someone on the phone. Unacceptable!
@Cicerone_org @AmericanAir @SamuelAdamsBeer they have been carrying it for a long time and it tastes old as all fuck
@AmericanAir looking at the app - it seems my flight has been cancelled. Who can I call to get on the next avail flight??
New Twitter is @united they're terrible... RT @vmoney7: Been on the phone with @unitedairlines for 40 mins. Horrible service wow.”
@JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
Still reeling over the horrendous service I received from @AmericanAir. Rudest "customer service" rep ever. Rebooked on @united... Later AA!
Omg @united and #LGA. waiting for a gate at midnight for 30+ mins after 2-hr flight delay is just cruel. #sotired #travelwoes
Attn @DeltaAssist Why do you wait until a flight is completely boarded before you announce a flight is delayed 1:15?
@TheBiancaDelRio @VirginAmerica @Virgin 23 hours in coach.the very fucking idea I don't like delta n partners because of that #neverflydelta
PHX airport way too crowded @AmericanAir @USAirways no where 2 sit long lines 4 bathroom. food planes waiting 4 gates http://t.co/8LLB7rs2NG
@JimmyChalk My parents have actually banned me from flying @united they're so bad. Something always goes wrong. Hope things work out soon!
@ImJakePaul @united UGGG United sucks
@AmericanAir you have the worst customer service supervisor in the industry they are extremely rude to your loyal customers
@united no we have arrived home now. yet another bad experience flying with you guys!
@AmericanAir flight 760... wait for us. We just landed in MIA. Please? We are hurrying! #SJUtoMIADelayed
A first! @SouthwestAir flight was delayed 25 then did donuts in the sky for 30 then diverted to OAK... And 40 mins later still on plane. Eep
@united all these people waiting for their luggage for an hour now flt 1577 from IAH to ORD help! http://t.co/8PoZwzHdqG
@united poor customer service before. during. and post flight 1518! Ugh
@JetBlue we've been on hold for 45 minutes &amp; have yet to speak to a human...are you adding the Denver flight today? #flight993
Worst experience ever on @united airlines #flight1580. Delayed over 2hrs. threatened to throw off bags. left behind if you left the plane.
@AmericanAir Flight tomorrow morning is cancelled and all lines to rebook are busy. Can anyone help?
First experience on @JetBlue last time on Jet Blue! Horrendous customer service. #badcustomerservice #fail #NeverAgain
First time @SouthwestAir has lost my luggage on way to St. Louis.  Bummer!  Hoping it gets here before my meeting tomorrow AM.
This is why you suck @united!!! 3 mins before we are to start boarding you change the fucking gate… http://t.co/yv1kO8A4ij
Rudest gate agent at C37 IAH to LAX.  Wouldn't put me on standby even though I have a fully refundable airfare and am premier gold. @United
@PerezHilton @AmericanAir We always have issues with American Airlines! Bad unresponsive customer service. rude ticketing attendants. etc
@AmericanAir liked to me that I couldn't change my flight and then another said I could. Probably gonna miss my flight cuz of the liar.
@stepha_07 https://t.co/vibz87hH3Y @united airlines  pilot did emergency landing and kicked off family with an autistic child
@AmericanAir Had a number of issues traveling with you last Friday...submitted a ticket...still no response! #help #unhappytraveler
@SouthwestAir should leave LAX it is almost a third world airport.  An hour wait for a checked bag following a near hour delay #Hell
.@United this is the worst safety video ever! Telling me how to buckle my seat belt whilst travelling in a taxi. C'mon.
@DeltaAssist ..Remind me to not fly to NRT/BKK fm DTW. Gate agent discriminatory re: volunteering. Sad.  Sorry. Fm loyal Plat+ Million Miler
Can someone please HELP and look into this issue before EOD @AmericanAir? Reference number to this request: 1-3564988085
Terrible treatment by @united airlines. Switching loyalty to @DeltaAssist  or @AmericanAir. Advice on which to choose? Goodbye @united!
@DeltaAssist Have been on hold for the RTW Award desk for over two hours.  Any idea on if I can get a call back instead?
And I now get to fly my hometown airline @united. Who did not try to illegally confiscate my voucher. Unlike @AmericanAir
Am i the only who thinks @AmericanAir sucks balls big time.  Always delayed at DFW! ALWAYS...i hate traveling...
Many peeps on our @americanair flight to DFW are missing connections. which is why we fly @AlaskaAir whenever we can. #drama
@united -nice job today. cancelled my flight without any notice. and only solution offered was another flight 2-days later #unbelievable!
@sampottorff @AmericanAir @GOLDENthe24k @EdwardZo shit
@AmericanAir flight 212 to LA is delayed 5 hours and I get a phone call less than one hour before flight time? Really? #poor service
@_gabygiraldo @TelleTWA @united hands down one of the worst airlines we've ever dealt with
@AmericanAir I'd like to discuss an issue regarding my AdvantageMiles.Kindly follow me so we can DM each other to resolve the problem.Thanks
@SouthwestAir I'm really upset how bags were handled in Vegas. Luggage soaked &amp; one bag came down ramp opened! Remedy 4 bags while raining??
@DeltaAssist another maintenance issue with this mornings plane. Waiting for a new one! #disappointed just want to get home!
@mlmasterson agreed that the cuts on breakfast sucks on @AmericanAir. but AUS at least has tacos :) also how can you be 0/4 on TSA Pre?
Dear Spirit Air Lies. aka @SpiritAirlines. $47 for bags. $50 per carryon. Shame on you. Next time I'm goin' @JetBlue http://t.co/3DdA1oymOn
on hold for 30 minutes before I gave up this late. since now my flights have no seats reserved. Another @AmericanAir experience going sour
45+ min delay on @SouthwestAir because an extra person onboard. Just go with assigned seating already. #ClownCar
Still waiting on a response from @united #NotShocked
@AmericanAir my @USAirways flight (3946) at 7am tomorrow was just cancelled. Is there anything you can do?
All I want to do is change first leg of trip. but @AmericanAir website won't empower me to do so online. Been on hold for over 30 minutes.
@DonaldEWinsor @F5paper @AmericanAir I've heard many such tales of American Airlines.  There could be a book...a whole volume of horror.
With @united I had one of the worst flight ever. 5 hours delay. bad service on the plane and still waiting my luggage. Wanna go home!
@VirginAmerica on flight VX 927 to SFO. Lead flight attendant â€œVictoriaâ€?. has much attitude. I guess itâ€™s ok to be rude and unaccommodating
Shout out to @JetBlue for giving me a roundtrip Tampa flight for $64.. Can't wait for Gasparilla next Saturday 😏
@AmericanAir. why are we stuck on this damned plane? Made us sit on the tarmac for 40 minutes. then there was an empty gate?
Stuck in Steamboat. on the phone with @AmericanAir and my call dropped. Please help!
So. @united ruined my return trip to Mexico. worst day ever. Worst customer service ever. I think next time i'm trying @VirginAmerica ðŸ‘
@AmericanAir You never fail to disappoint!
Screw @TSA. screw @AlaskaAir for charging $25 to check a bag. and screw "The New America."
Excited for my first trip on @VirginAmerica! It sucks I'm in a middle seat but hey. it's main cabin express (that's good. right?)
.@AmericanAir is officially the worst airline. Cancelled my ticketed seats 2 days b4 departure &amp; couldn't add my #TSAprecheck 2 the ticket.
Stranded in Madrid.Thanks @united. not sure how u did but u have no record of me flying from Canada to Spain &amp; then cancel my return booking
@JetBlue pretty disappointed w trying to buy tix in your app. Won't let me update payment info or select seats--hope I don't lose the fare.
dear @AlaskaAir how is it possible that I NEVER get TSA Pre with you? Have been a Global Entry since forever. When I fly @Delta I always do
Another delayed departure for @united out of DCA. Apparently they are struggling with new concepts such as "bags" and "fuel."
@united I'm having a huge problem with your partner @CopaAirlines. Can you help me as a United Elite?
@AmericanAir u suck
@united @EricHarland1 @united with retweet. @DeltaAssist is killing the game though. I wish. @JetBlue had more destinations. #truth
So what else is new!! Flight delayed for maintenance @united
Very disappointed to hear about the Islamophobic employee at @united. Guess I won't be flying United anytime soon.  #unitedfortahera
@AmericanAir why is there nobody around to talk to about the omnishambles of flight aa267 which is currently 15 hours delayed?
Really @united? Couldn't let 10 pax you made late from #SFO board a 6am #OHare flight at 5:55? 11 hrs unreasonable to wait. Epic #fail
I apologize @SouthwestAir . you sent the email 91 fucking SECONDS before it was supposed to take off http://t.co/G4gaX27ezg
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 31 minutes. Your service is a awful
@united extremely unhappy that wheelchairs requested for elderly parents were not there for them in Denver. will be reporting it.
@SouthwestAir On hold with nonrev/jumpseat number for over 80 minutes now with no answer - did phone number or listing policy change?
@united After a week back and forth there are no seats left on this flight.  Too bad @united dragged their feet on this. What a cluster
@guynormanbee @VirginAmerica and out before the bad weather hit. Nice!
@AmericanAir one canceled connection will delay me 30 hours and add 2 more flights? Really?
@SouthwestAir disappointed SW1516 is an older jet. No WiFi. Hope you update your entire fleet soon. BizSelect-ers require WiFi.
God damn it American Airlines. you fat bastard.  Make me miss my connections two times in one weekend. I hate you @AmericanAir
#communication is all it takes sometimes to improve a bad situation @DeltaAssist #Fargo #training #flyingsucks
Had the WORST airport experience of my entire life with an @AmericanAir worker today
@AmericanAir poor excuse. I need 2 make 2 flights nxt mnth &amp; will avoid u &amp; @USAirways due 2 this ordeal. @jetblue. @Delta - here i come!
.1 Mbps?! 60's era speeds on new A321 @Gogo #speedtest @AmericanAir #fail http://t.co/eX7X1aGCoC
@AmericanAir dissatisfied w/flight1544 DFW/Bos. Delayed2x. Told no room for bag Agent rude Look@ pic there WAS room. http://t.co/rMwjxwvLZS
I cannot imagine how anyone would get in trouble for punching them in the face after the numerous unsaid rules broken by @SouthwestAir 3/3
@CharlesMBlow @united Ugh!  Train is better--but nothing is foolproof.  Perhaps walking...?
@JetBlue  yeahh umm you people better get your priorities straight cause the way you treated @MatthewLush  is completely unacceptable!
@JetBlue Hi hardworking social media rep! Can you tell me why flight 824 is delayed? 6 year old won't take "because" for an answer anymore
Is @united the worst airlines ever?!? Yeah I think so!
@AlexDonno I started it on a plane yesterday but stupid @AmericanAir sucks so I had to finish it today. Still weird. End is stupid.
@united at what point is an hour too long to wait for bags by all passengers flight 1065 to EWR? Or bag services to be complacent?
@Lonely_Dad @united shut up dad u fucking whiny asshole
@SouthwestAir fucking sucks ass.
@united :Got an issue with United?  Read 2 letters Ralph Nader sent to UAL's CEO.  http://t.co/NRCaKp7V9P  http://t.co/0stXqYJ3oP
@AmericanAir I have now been on hold for 68 minutes and 23 seconds.  You guys provide some seriously shitty customer service.
@deltaassist Despite tag my bag got left in JFK yesterday. Was supposed to be on flight to PIT that *did* leave today but it wasnt. help?
@kimrhodes4real @JayRuderman @JudyWoodruff @united So is my nephew. I hate ignorance. this is sickening.
@AmericanAir ur awful :)
@SouthwestAir my wife's flight has been cancelled and she's been on hold for an hour and a half to try and figure out a change/refund. #help
@AmericanAir  AA is terrible!!!! Constantly changing my flights and layover times with no regard to if the timetable is even possible!!!
@SouthwestAir - pro tip: when your recording says the wait for an agent is between 8 &amp; 11 min - and I'm still sitting here after 23 min #No
Sitting on the runway. waiting for a gate to open. Let's get moving. @SouthwestAir #MDW #464
@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service in America
@DeltaAssist I have been sitting on plane for over two hours. Any idea how much longer? It's flight DL2668.
@Gogo and @AlaskaAir The internet connection on flight 632 to LAS is horrible. I'm not able to stay connected long enough to send an email.
@united has failed me and @ktallz2thewall. Been stranded in Houston since yesterday at 8am while other airlines have been landing in Lubbock
â€œ@alexishenson:Hey @SouthwestAir. you've made my mom mad &amp; now she's says she plans on calling you to let you know. You've been forewarnedâ€ðŸ˜‚
@AmericanAir Work on your User experience. your current user interface is crap and your employees have no class #horrible #4timesinarow
Get your shit together @AmericanAir
#TheNewAmerican @USAirways @AmericanAir. Plane broke down in Ashevile so they are vanning us to Charlotte but will miss connecting flight.
@united stuck on the ground in DC due to a snow delay in Chicago. I guess making my ORD-LAX and LAX-ITO connection is tough. Suggestions?
Delayed yet again @dfwairport @AmericanAir. It's sad when you expect it to happen . Whole trip a complete mess. #NeverAgain #aasucks
@DeltaAssist Hi. I switched from an SWA flight to Delta.  Price quoted 660 (same as SWA) credit card charged 960.
@AmericanAir They told us in flight the wrong meals were delivered in first. Our selection was unavailable. Could have been worse I guess.
Bed time when WiFi doesn't work on @Southwestair as expected. Hope clients aren't pissed. Missed work deadlines. http://t.co/RVxy1Rv8Jx
@PHXSkyHarbor @USAirways @AmericanAir really disappointed w ur custservice. I was on canceled US690 and now I'm stuck here until tmw.
@SouthwestAir why does WN 1122 smf-las say on time on SWA website but 80minute delay per @flightstats?
@united Holy shit. what a tone deaf and downright nasty use of a standard non-apology form response. Do you get paid for that JJ?
@AmericanAir Saved miles 10+years. Booked award tickets to Sydney 300+ in advance. but couldn't get business or first. Failed again today
@united Delaying me an entire day to get home to #MyDubai with zero compensation. And this is why I choose never to fly #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir if only that were true. They are not assigning seats online not answering their phones. They are the worst
@united I understand. technology has problems sometimes. Could you re-assign my seat for me? Will DM mileageplus number if it helps
@jerharlanCNN @United Ugg! Better than. "we don't have the manual so we have to print one before we can leave."
@DeltaAssist why do your headphones jacks never work on your planes? What is the point of showing movies w/ no sound? #badcustomerservice
@united Bringing Xmas presents home but my case didn't arrive on UA42. Promised delivery at 4pm. still waiting :( http://t.co/0Cgwa4v6AK
Hey @VirginAmerica U can't do jack re the vocal toddler kicking my seat or the gorilla sharing my armrest but what about working audio? #boo
@DeltaAssist just screwed my travel plans. Crew did not show and no credit for travel or reimbursement!!!!
@SouthwestAir I don't know why SWA would rather leave 215 passengers abandoned in Austin for 4 hours than keep a 50cent light bulb in stock
I'm mad I couldn't take that job with @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist my flight is stuck at the gate with mechanical problems. I'm afraid I'm going to miss my connecting flight. How can I rebook!
@DeltaAssist worst flight I have ever had. Moved our seats with out warning. No in flight service and the wifi didnt work. Never again delta
Got some terrible service from @AmericanAir today. You'd think it would be better considering how much money we spend on airfare.
@united sitting at gate 92 ewr waiting for jetway while someone's reading the paper in the jetway?
So @united has once again failed and family is stuck in Denver for the night - hey everyone - never fly united. multiple times #Fail
What the hell is happening on #jfk @cnn no info from @jetblue and hour and a half in newark trapped in a plane #help
Ugh @AmericanAir flight 296 has been sitting on the Tarmac for almost 30 minutes to get to a gate!! This is almost as long as the flight
@SouthwestAir is always reliably late. #southwestairlines #travel #airlinenightmares
@VirginAmerica I regret not spending a little extra to fly with you to Seattle. We missed our flight because @AlaskaAir had no ticket agent.
@AmericanAir AA4227 delayed...plane issue....
@united has crappy service and now their racist too #NotMyAmerica
@united the miscommunication and confusion surrounding my flight has been embarrassing. I understand delays. But this is really terrible
@DeltaAssist I need a flight home from jfk to Slc. I just missed my last flight. Can you help?
Just got that call from @SouthwestAir that my flight is delayed 3 hours. ðŸ˜ž
After a broken plane and a stuck TUG we are finally on our way! PIT to PHX @SouthwestAir #PEX2015
Very disappointed @AmericanAir supervisor Karen for extremely poor customer service re: flight 1664
@united help! @LesleyArens needs to fligh from DC to Orlando... Flight is overbooked... Her Firstflight of the day was delayed in Brussels.
@MrRyanMorrison @VirginAmerica they definitely just trolled the shit out of you
@United Why UA4 (12.04.2014 IAH-LAX) states "no customers waiting to upgrade"?? I've been waiting over a month!!! http://t.co/E94YSoXeIz
@SouthwestAir delay my flight... I dare you.
I truly believe that @united has one purpose and it is to completely mess up my travel plans and waste hours/days of my life.
@Amber_Raynexxx @AmericanAir  They Suck !!
@sabler @JetBlue I'm pretty sure "pressure from investors to boost profits" is the root of all modern-day evil.
@AmericanAir you are awful. Pilot no show 1st leg and 2nd now sitting for maintenance. You can't do anything for me? I call bs. Fix this!
I think @united needs to change their name. They don't know what it is to be united at all. Me &amp; my family will never use their services.
@AmericanAir So you messed up last time my wife traveled. so you gave her a voucher. She uses the voucher and you mess that up too? Really?
@Joe_Gatto @united What kinda mess did You make?? Lol #ImpracticalJokers
Boarding @VirginAmerica is like waiting in line for a hot. inefficient. nightclub. http://t.co/x0hoqenfVc
@jetblue Looks like a portion of your site is broken. Can't book a flight. Can you let me know when it's back up?  http://t.co/5sn4maNhoZ
Heading down to So Flo from New York. Struggling for room. can't wait to get there! Highly recommend @JetBlue @NBATV http://t.co/pnz8ogSvSj
Ugh. this last trip made me add @united and @Uber to the "List of companies I had to fight over customer support" :(
@AmericanAir sucks.  Non moving lines and workers who couldn't care less.
@united Hi. My flight from LHR to EWR is delayed by 80 mins. I will miss my connection in NY to MKE; help???
@JetBlue way to screw up business for your airline.reducing legroom. No way i'm taking JetBlue next summer going for @Delta  So long jbu!
@textfiles you're right.. @JetBlue and @VirginAmerica/@VirginAtlantic actually give a shit about customers. All the rest? Nope.
@united @NY_NJairports EWR is the worst at baggage?! What's the deal? Each/every time its over 20-25 min #sucks #wtf #really #its11pmwhysong
CLT to RDU and the luggage takes longer than the flight #waytoolong #customerservice @USAirways @AmericanAir
Wish I chose #MDW and the rockstar team @SouthwestAir  instead of #ORD and @AmericanAir ... 3 hours stuck INSIDE plane at gate #AA395
@SouthwestAir Assigned seating is much less stressful. especially when traveling with an infant.
@AmericanAir How long should I expect to wait for a reply from Customer Relations? Sent email Monday...no response yet.
@SkiLefley tomorrow because @AmericanAir is terrible
Hey @united - still sitting on the tarmac for ~120 minutes with no end in sight no drink/food. #ua3396
@DeltaAssist flight is delayed and I will miss my connection. Any chance to stay and leave tomorrow morning?
Disappointed that I have to cancel my @VirginAmerica Visa card. but @askcomenity is awful. #BringBack @barclays
@AmericanAir hey @Delta. what can I do about xfring my loyalty back.  I'm about to be gold for @USAirways and am unhappy w my change
Now I don't think my problems with @AmericanAir are that bad after seeing what they did to this family http://t.co/L7ICSlgbDK
@united now it's a 4 hour delay!!!??? You guys have some nerve!
@AlaskaAir not nice can't land in Mexico with a plane that belongs in #Hawaii :( I miss Hawaii... #NextTime http://t.co/Et9VvuPamf
@united Does 1K support respond at all anymore? Still waiting after 17 days for a reply.
Avoiding all future shared bookings with @AmericanAir @British_Airways after ruining our trip to NYC. AA offer $25 compensation #disgusted
Hey @united when you play a safety video 3x after we've been overheating on the tarmac 2 hours you're inviting a violent riot.
@united more broken airplanes   it's another stressful day   you really suck balls   #united #haiku
@AmericanAir YOU TOTALLY SCREWED UP OUR FLIGHT! NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINE THEY ARE HORRIBLE
Havnt traveled @AmericanAir since 2010 and nothing has changed. Delayed as always. attitude from staff. no explanation. 👎✈️✈️
@DeltaAssist Flight delayed. Finally board now forcing 2 people off due 2 weight. Another delay 2 reorder. poor communication w/passengers
@SouthwestAir I'm having alt of trouble checking in my flight. highly disappointed. Online won't work and I've been on the phone for an hour
Never fails @AmericanAir is always late! And no it's not because of the weather in Dallas it's because of "maintenance".. smh
I hate when @SouthwestAir doesn't fly where I'm going. The seats on this @united flight are clearly not designed for adult-sized people.
I'm mad @Delta @DeltaAssist change my preferred seat on my flight tomorrow. and now trying to make me pay to change it back #SHADE
@united Trying to get mileage credit for past flight website of no use. And I fear this is of no use also. Need POC to resolve issue.
@alaskaair - wardrobe closet shouldnt be crews personal storage. 1st on board &amp; it's full of their bags #badservice #wrinkledsuitsarebad
@DeltaAssist @Delta say it isn't so! I booked you JFK to SFO today over @JetBlue or @VirginAmerica because you advertised Live TV but no TV!
Never fly @AirCanada or @united...The Star Alliance of incredibly shitty airlines.
@united. you have 1 attendant checking in 2 flights worth of economy passengers at Munich. &gt; 1 hr wait. please staff appropriately.
Another delayed flight...c'mon @SouthwestAir
Stop lying to me @JetBlue! I'm still sitting in O'Hare waiting for the plane to arrive. Someday you'll be on time... http://t.co/aqu8MI25p7
Opt'd for an aisle seat over middle @united Premier. Major fail. First time in my life I wished for shorter legs. http://t.co/o3kbnmM80V
@united this is how you 2B seat on flight 79 to tkyo from ewr lioked like. Ask me if the system worked? Awful. http://t.co/4wMKwNZkv9
Waiting to board our @united flight to our honeymoon.  How about an upgrade #UnitedAirlines ?? #Upgrade
@united I'm stuck for 28 hours in LAX trying to get home to SAT. You cancelled my flight. this is probably going to be a loud night.
@scott_crow Man. @JetBlue is so bad. they make @united look like @emirates. Count on a bad experience with them at least half the time :/
@JetBlue @cwolicki Your online reservation system just took my $ and didn't confirm a seat. Please please don't fail me too.
@AmericanAir WE BLOWING SHIT UP from @theholykuran @cloutgod @nikowavy
@AmericanAir waited 40 mins for a call back phone rang no agent on phone
.@united is by far the worst airline I have ever flown.
“@cfkatinos: I've now been hold for 1 hour now @SouthwestAir”they were trying to help you not be a wimp and leave Las Vegas early. #loser
Stuck in Houston...had first class and now they took my seat away because they changed the airplane @united #merryEffinXmas
@JetBlue Sorry. what do you mean by DM. Happy to share details of tonight's really crappy experience.
This is officially the worst flight I've ever had. @SouthwestAir. I fly to LA 2-3x a month and this is insane.
My entire business is in my suite case that has been lost by @united why hasn't it been found yet? It's been a day #badcustomerservice
So frustrated w/ flight issues w/ @AmericanAir - 2 extra days in Chicago. 2 flight cancelations. no snow boots #PleaseLetMeGoHomeNow
@VirginAmerica what's up with the counter staff at LGA this morning??  Rudest hospitality staff ever...definitely going back to AA.
Hi @DeltaAssist I has an awful expert on board one of your flights yesterday and I would like to complain
.@united &amp; @Orbitz lawsuit against travel website shows how ridiculous airline ticket pricing really is.  http://t.co/3zkrZg07Nk
@AmericanAir How do I get USAir to answer the phone?  AA told me to call them.  Been on hold more than one hour 15 min!
@SpiritAirlines @AmericanAir If I promise never to stray again. no matter convenient time. will you please please bring me home from CES?!
Sorry to all on @AmericanAir flight with me. Baby will be crying because airline ruined her day!
@AmericanAir never buying an AA ticket again.
@SouthwestAir Except your wi-fi is horrible and can't get on anything but twitter so i'd like my $8 back. please.
My friend Katie is a saint. She's been on hold for 4 hours with @americanair
1hr 30mins on hold and going strong. Must be some sort of record for Premier 1K support line @united http://t.co/CjZJntvoaG
@JetBlue Hey. what's going on with Flight 958 from AUA to JFK? It says delayed but the estimated departure time has passed. Any updates?
aka â€œChecked bags are no longer freeâ€. Nice try. @jetblue! #noSpinZone
@AmericanAir aa 975 is delayed and trying to make aa 1698. Any advice?
@AmericanAir has been cancelling flights from Colombia without explanations what is up with that.  Will not be flying with them ever.
@united if you could change my flight from oct 7th to oct 8th! we booked online using comps we received from a flight problem in May
@DeltaAssist my suitcase is destroyed!!! http://t.co/zE121nygj9
@AmericanAir you guys are utterly ridiculous. My husband has been on a plane for 6 hours. With a granola bar. I HATE YOU.
Note to self: no longer fly @AmericanAir regional jets.
@AmericanAir you have just ruined my birthday. Your delayed flight Dallas/Boston will result in me missing my first class flight to London
@DeltaAssist My fight from DFW to LGA was diverted to PIT and has been cancelled. Can you help rebook me for either LGA or DFW?
So...passing the time at ABI. Delayed flight w 2nd time change. If RGV weren't so far I would've driven. Come on @SouthwestAir
#NewYearsResolution: Never check my bags again. Still waiting 30 minutes later. @SouthwestAir http://t.co/33IvXz71Dh
@SouthwestAir worst customer service- holding on phone 2 hours
@SouthwestAir with an epic fail in Phx!! This is unacceptable. I won't be making this mistake again.
Why does every @united flight I take through @fly2ohare end up delayed or canceled? #travel #Chicago
@AmericanAir go to hell ! Extortion! A woman who came in a whelk chair is sitting in the exit row! Don't worry my next call is to the FAA!
â€œ@mindhearted: My family is stuck in Madrid with paid tix to get home to Chicago but can't get boarding pass."  What's the deal @AmericanAir
Thank you @margaretcho for standing up for pre boarding for people w/special needs! You blew it big time @VirginAmerica
@JetBlue just frustrating to pay for extra space and I'm getting it.
@united hi. please help out @sammywilk with his luggage issues. It's of utmost important. he's a musician with a show to do at 4.
@SouthwestAir Just got a @TripIt alert abt 3 hr delay on 2515. no word from SW. On hold for almost 30 min. Need info!
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 3 months flying MKE/ORD/LHR delayed 12 hours. Wonder if you'll lose my bag this time again too? #nothappy
Hey @SouthwestAir I'm not able to scroll down in your new app to purchase flight. Is this a problem or is it just me?
Still stuck in @united's frequent flyer line watching people who arrived after us get served from the economy line.  What loyalty?
@AmericanAir My bags missed connection last night. Told they should've arrived @ 9:30 this AM but still missing. On hold for an hour. Help??
@JetBlue what happened? Worst customer experience I've had in a while. Don't expect you to be Virgin. but wow. Make an effort!
@kumailn @VirginAmerica My wife left an iPod on a flight and called customer service within an hour of deplaning. Response was don't bother.
@Mauleon69 @AmericanAir you can claim for your delayed flight. Check to see if youâ€™re entitled to compensation- http://t.co/jvoyeXdnK0
Lady complaining to @SouthwestAir rep about flight delay of 1 hour. I've been stuck here in DAL for 3 hrs with at least 2 hrs more to wait.
@tunkuv @united Never fly United. They are the worst.
@united one of your check in employees at Yvr talked to my family and I like we were dogs. This isn't even an exaggeration. I would never.
@SouthwestAir flying from BWI to OAK via DEN. In air. Confirmation #8UJGSO. Looks like will miss connection in Denver. How can you help?
@VirginAmerica sent DM and no response?
If the Premier Access line is always longer than the regular line. what is the point? @United
Hey. @AmericanAir staffing all (2) check in stations at #sea with trainees is a bad idea. Staff should know how to use the computers. Awful.
@VirginAmerica why do I pay for priority ticket when I just get funneled into the same line? @JetBlue more speed is better #fail #nothappy
@united waiting over 30 minutes for baggage what's the holdup? Hundreds want to know ... Anyone work here? #travel http://t.co/xd2Cq3Es9x
@SouthwestAir trying to get on an earlier flight from PIt--&gt;mdw on hold for 30 mins is there another number to call???!!!
@americanair you platinum desk sucks too.  Looking forward to end of wright act. #AmericanAirlinesSux
@united Standard procedure to ignore customer complaints? I have emailed 3 times in a week still no response. Owed $300. Worst airline ever.
Dear @SouthwestAir you can have your credit card back. we're over.  This is my last unexplained 3HR delay at Midway.  Is @JetBlue up to par?
just when I thought @united might have changed their ways.... BAM! Flight delay
@united have been waiting for almost 2 hours for our bags to be unloaded from the airplane at dia #flyingsouthwestfromnowon #Ridiculousness
8 hour delay. no apology. Vegas plans for eve ruined. 12 dollar voucher.  Really. @AmericanAir ?!?
@SouthwestAir lost my bags and only want to give me $50. -___-
@AmericanAir you are the worst airline in the world
@united worst cstmr svc ever!
@JetBlue website kept crashing. Very disappointed.
Having the worst experience with @united. Last week flight delayed 24 hours and today cancelled. Both times related to Aircraft issues.
2 hour delay. had to go back to gate after sitting on runway to de ice plane for a second time then land with no gate! @VirginAmerica brutal
Oh and by the way they said they only profit $10 from our ticket #bullshit @JetBlue
jamming to on-hold tunes @jetblue what's the wait time looking like?
#fail for @united UA817 over 3 hrs delayed w plane in hangar &amp; no cleaners available causing add't delay?
@AmericanAir What happens if I miss ExPlat b/c of my missed segment today due to mechanical failure. what recourse do I have? I fear none.
SWA. why no Fly By Priority line at BWI tonight? Fail! @SouthwestAir #disappointed http://t.co/Xe9Neuisfc
@SouthwestAir you cancelled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also cancelled flights to LGA. Yet @united is flying on time to both. WTH??
Best thing about flying @united is that you never know which gate will actually be the final departing gate.
@LuxAlptraum how frustrating is that?! Hope @americanair straightens their shit out.
HEY @united @LANAirlines I still have not received or heard anything back from you guys on my lost luggage ... it has been 4 days now...
Second flight delay to Atlanta in a row by @DeltaAssist I just want to go home ðŸ˜’
@united first delayed. then cancelled. You SUCK.
Nothing is worse than an airline losing your bags. @SouthwestAir please figure out where my bags are. I am very upset
@Americanair my flight delay caused a lot of problems in my flight. Now I'm stuck at the airport. Wait time is almost 12hrs.
@AmericanAir. @wmbligh could have easily been alerted of delay and avoided a 24hr travel day. Is the because of the merger or is it typical?
Airline issues apology after mistreating vet. service dog http://t.co/z315cnHqD5 via @usatod &lt;= @AmericanAir attendant needs to be fired!
@SouthwestAir kid unfriendly Airline don't wanna get on this flight #dontwannafly #southwest #horriblecustomerservice
@DeltaAssist JFK a mess today. Gates changing. 2hr delay and no-one knows where the actual plane is we are supposed to be taking DL438
@United can’t wait for you guys to get us to cancun for our honeymoon this morning!
@united F*** united airlines for screwing people over. You guys are shit and need to get it together. Never flying with them again.
@SouthwestAir seriously...three airports in less than 10 hours. Terrible customer service in every one. #HowDoISellMyRewarsPoints
@AmericanAir having really bad customer service experience amending my flight. can you contact me please as already called you twice!!!
Over an hour and still no bags! Do you plan on keeping them @united?
"Co-pilot's seat needs to be replaced."  Can always count on @united to find new ways to screw up.
@united Waiting time for baggage agent is ridiculous. Spent the last hour waiting for a Premier agent. Any updates on my bag please?
@AmericanAir HATE I paid extra for leg room only to be locked in a seat with permanent armrests #disappointed #misled
@united Worst service EVER. Used 1K global upgrades yesterday. Ok'd by mgr on phone. today taken away by other mgr. Shame on u United UNFair
@DeltaAssist Been on hold for over 90 mins with no indication of how long wait time is. Can you help?
Trying to buy extra points to fly @SouthwestAir and that particular page has kicked me out on 3 different browsers. 2 different computers.
@DeltaAssist why is DL5952 cancelled tomorrow? Flight ops surely must have been resumed.
@AlaskaAir just be careful you are not wearing a face mask and get removed from your flight - just bad cust service
My flight has been delayed for 4 hours. DEN to DSM airport. I just want to get home. #UnitedAirlines @CanceledFlight @delayflight @united
@JetBlue why is my flight 1152 out of MCO to BOS delayed?
No one likes a bully. @united .  Still sad over Continental joining your ranks.  http://t.co/NsAHEki27G
My flight to Texas on Thursday was 3 hours delayed. Then my suitcase was lost upon return to DIA. Never flying @united again.
Another flight delay. We have maintenance on the plane. Seriously I don't understand whats been up with this airline lately @JetBlue
Hey @JetBlue what do I do if I lost a pair of glasses on a plane? Called the baggage claim at the airport but they didn't see them...
@AmericanAir the @USAirways first class product is horrible. Red eye flight w no pillow?
@united Any idea why my plane is sitting on the Tarmac in #IND for "unknown reasons" ?!? #SOS
Fuk @USAirways @AmericanAir worst airline ever
@AmericanAir flights leaving Houston are consistently delayed. Aggravating.
@adamhousley @DeltaAssist please wait the next available agent will be with you shortly. Poetic on groundhog day
Such bullshit. plane had to land in VA because they didn't empty the toilet in FL. @JetBlue. a free alcoholic beverage would be cool now.
Hey @AmericanAir someone sold my number to you and now I'm getting harassed.  Guess who's never flying American again?
@HirlihyBoy @flystl @AmericanAir American Airlines has the worst customer service. I'll pay more to fly another carrier. They're awful.
I'm allergic to most animals including mink coats which my @AmericanAir seat neighbor will not store above b/c "it's not allowed" #fail
Landed! No gate. Usually very patient but I have to be back at the airport tomorrow to leave again want to see Fam. Looking at you @united
@united I'm having issues. Yesterday I rebooked for 24 hours after I was supposed to fly. now I can't log on &amp; check in. Can you help?
@AmericanAir fuck you Motherfuker
I am a frequent @JetBlue flyer (ex-Mosaic) and annoyed that seat pitch was being reduced BUT their commitment to LEO's trumps that by 100
@USAirways @AmericanAir ugh! 4th time I am going to end up hanging up bcz I hav a meeting and can't stay on hold. http://t.co/m7coyEvrDX
@united Passenger @KristinaRibali is having a horrid time waiting on ORD to Washington DC. and she can't be the only unhappy passenger.
This @AmericanAir flight is a shit show. Old lady and guy in a wheelchair fighting viciously about overhead bin space.  #FloridaLife
@united sent details via DM. This is a very frustrating situation. I have yet to get the same answer from agents - its a new story everytime
@united This is "priority" boarding? I miss Continental. http://t.co/8PIjAA6ZNo
When @United spits on 1K members. it's time to leave &amp; head to @Delta  Read my #travel story: http://t.co/rgHag5ip5P http://t.co/RJyQVzRsLU
@united in DEN stuck - Missed flt due 2 delayed flt -Next flt 3:35- delayed + now canceled. Now on7:42pm flt -Can't I get UAL club pass?
@united with the flight attendants leaving SEATAC. should I be switching to Delta for more and better service here?
Since I had such a bad holiday because of my flight here. decided to let @SouthwestAir extort me to get a seat that won't give me a migraine
Getting on an airplane. it’s @united so likely no wifi.  I’m not ignoring you. I’m just flying 80’s style
@AmericanAir never issues with other airlines. Mom with two toddlers should not have to worry about getting put on a flight 4 hours later.
@AlaskaAir is trying to charge $150 to fix a typo and I've been on hold with @Expedia for 35 minutes. 😠
@SouthwestAir: help. please! Pregnant best friend on 589. going home to DCA-flight cancelled. still on hold after an hour.  Help reschedule?
Smh first my bag was ruined now my flight has been delayed twice @DeltaAssist #immissingthegrammys
@JustinGhazvini @AmericanAir that's some shit
@DeltaAssist @Jorja64 So @DeltaAssist can't issue Sky Club pass and neither can any Delta agents at DFW? #stillnotwowedbydelta
Been at airport all day because flight supposedly got cancelled then uncancelled and the desk lady was being rude and disrespectful @united
@DeltaAssist I have and no one has responded..so unacceptable
@AmericanAir I submitted a complaint online. It only allowed 1.500 characters. which was not nearly enough. When will I be contacted?
Just saw video of a @AlaskaAir passenger with cancer kicked off plane b/c her doc didnt give a note to fly. No decency in air travel anymore
@AmericanAir - was the thought behind a "new American" to downgrade? Useless headrests. seats that recline 1 inch. on an intl flight? #fail
@AlaskaAir separated our party of 6 including an 84. a 5 and a 2 year old so nobody could sit together. Why bother assigning seats?
@DeltaAssist can't stream the Masters through my iPhone app on @Gogo #frustrating
@AmericanAir are you able to contact me directly to mitigate an issue
So annoyed @united I have tiny carry on. plus laptop bag &amp; cause I board last I have to check it cause no one checks bags to avoid fees.
I haven't even got on the flight and already hate @united... Last person on and a middle seat. #NotStoked @Delta help!
@mattwham DM me and I’ll fill you in. I regularly fly this route and @VirginAmerica consistently the worst link in the Virgin family.
So disappointed in @SouthwestAir service today in #ATX. Makes me never want to fly this airline again.
@JetBlue please take care of the problem with @MatthewLush and @Nickalaws!!!!!! #ByeRegina87346
"SO you're trying to make a payment online? Then that's a problem w/ the website" NO not when you're using SPECIFICALLY MileagePlusX @united
@DeltaAssist they weren't  accommodating; I took it upon myself. I could not stand the smell. I expected better service.
Disgusting treatment this weekend from @United! My family and I are appalled!!!!
@AmericanAir why aren't chairmans is air upgrades clearing 7 days out any more? We have to wait until 24 hours. Defeats purpose of benefit
flying southwest in march. gonna miss the flyfi. snacks. drinks. extra space. and directv. a whole lot. we still cool though? @JetBlue 💙
@curtisstigers @united I am just thankful that Heathrow didn't let you down by cancelling - or else you might still not be home.  xxx
Another @AmericanAir flight hopefully no delays and no baggage lost. Fingers crossed
@AmericanAir 4 planes out of service this am at LAS including the one I'm on.. Possibly time for routine tune ups?
Very upset the 14000 miles I expected to get on a @united ticket bought back in OCTOBER will only be 5.000 because I depart 6 days into Mar!
I bet $100 bucks this @united flight won't leave on time.
Off to #NYC for an exciting meeting! It's time to innovate! Btw @virginamerica hate having my seat… http://t.co/zK0NggVwou
45 mins and still no bags? What's going on @united??
@united killing me! Can't get my cancelled flight fixed! Absolute worst!
@united it was a joke. Your customer service is the worst. they hung up on my friend after an hour.
@DeltaAssist  Trying to do early check in for flight &amp; getting message. I have no e-ticket.  That's kinda strange. hopefully not a problem
Guy in Chicago airport attempts suicide. must've flown @AmericanAir! i felt like it when i stuck in plane for 4hrs on 45min flight! #CNN
@AmericanAir why is flight 1022 stuck on runway in COS for 2 hrs? Delay @ DFW?
Crowds are getting angry waiting for this @Delta flight from Atlanta to Philly... Will we ever board??! @DeltaAssist
@AmericanAir I will be filing a complaint with my MEP if I don't hear something from you this week.
@DeltaAssist how long does it usually take for you all to respond to concerns our complaints...?
@DeltaAssist A nightmare day. Now my flight out of MSP has been delayed. I was supposed to be in Houston at about 2:30 this afternoon (1/3)
@united frequent flyer here &amp; self checked bag area @ ORD is a mess. Confused flyers. rude attendants. Gotta be a simpler way.
@DEVrockstarr @AmericanAir @WWEAJLee broke? lmao alright.
Definitely be the last time I'll ever deal with @united #awful
@SouthwestAir asked at 800iflyswa if I could get upgraded to biz select or drink tics Was given a number for corp office. Upset loyal cust
@united my next flight is UA25 if I dont make it to this one i miss that one. is there anything you can do?
Boarding a @SouthwestAir flight is a MUCH more stressful version of figuring out where to sit on the bus to an elementary school field trip
@SouthwestAir what say we stop the "every 15 min new delay" game? Is flight 400 leaving BWI tonight? Yes or no? Your people said to get here
Of course another delay.... @united your airline is TERRIBLE on God.
@SouthwestAir I held for 20 minutes. spoke with a rep who said she would change my reservation &amp; has put me on hold for another 20 mins
@SouthwestAir your delays are really killing me.
@AmericanAir Worst flight ever. never again.
Over 1 hour waiting on the line for a @united supervisor and still nobody can talk to me http://t.co/ST46NRV0rJ
@mattfazzi @JetBlue I've never had a good experience with them.  Sorry man.
@AmericanAir said our bags would be delivered yesterday for sure. Still no bags! I would have picked it up had I known this would happen.
Can get to Cabo but no flights at all back??? Help @SouthwestAir
Flight 1794 delayed now for 4th time due to maintainable.....What gives @DeltaAssist ? Can't just pull in a new plane?
Oh. @SouthwestAir ... You never cease to amaze me. Always finding new ways to de-glamorize air travel. #leastfavoriteairline
@AmericanAir ~20x thru ORD on @United and never 1x in Penalty Boxâ€¦2nd flight ever here on AA and 20m in the holeâ€¦replace ur ops staff or IT.
@DeltaAssist 3 days in a row waiting to talk to customer service.  Waited over an hour each time I tried to call and had to hang up! #rage
. @united at SFO since 8 this morning and missing my flight for YUL because of many delays + no solution at overcrowded customer service :(
Having to switch flights for work and not being able to make any of the @JetBlue options work is literally devastating  ha... #notv #boo
Never that I'm on your site looking now flights to Dallas next Monday RT @JetBlue: @JadCity WHAAAAAT...Remy? Don't go breaking our heart!!!
@SouthwestAir Searching 4 RIC-&gt;BNA I get a no flights msg for all dates. Even if direct isnt option why not offer multi-leg routes? #deadend
@SouthwestAir so disappointed about  lack of customer provided
I have the worst luck with airlines. @AmericanAir lost my luggage. Someone Help! 😭😭😭
@AmericanAir how is it possible to not know a part is missing from a PLANE!!  At risk of missing my connection! Ruining my vacation#help
http://t.co/Uuyn21PbP1 Too little too late @united. Your best former customers have #unitedforvirgin @VirginAmerica
@DeltaAssist you want to tax my parents $250 to sit together on a flight with open seats? They've had tickets for a month! #poorform #fail
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir I'll get my hammer. Oh wait I don't work for them.
Hey @JetBlue I'm at Laguardia waiting to board and no announcements. Any thoughts? Flight #499
@AmericanAir 2 hours late for an hour flight and no apology. Next time I'm flying a company with a little more LUV @SouthwestAir
I get it's raining. but the fact our bags are literally soaked through and dripping is a tad ridiculous @DeltaAssist http://t.co/bPXbIJ9As2
@AmericanAir fuck yall. I haven't been home in 5 months and you cancel my flight bc of weather? It's 72 where I'm supposed to be landing
@AlaskaAir you suck at luggage in SLC waiting well over 30 minutes
@AmericanAir Words only. Sitting on shuttle bus again for 30mins. Shame. Never flying #AA again. Or @usairways for that matter. #fail
@united a plane full of people delayed 3 hours would really like a gate agent to come to C113 @ EWR so we can deplane . #unitedfail
@DeltaAssist JFK--&gt;BOS @ 5:00pm cancelled. No text/email. 4+ hr hold for call. Am I rebooked? Refunded? Need to figure out travel options!
@united THIS HAS BEEN MY WORST AIRPORT EXPERIENCE EVER. UR VEGAS FLIGHT COULDNT WAIT 5MIN FOR UR OTHER PLANE  TO RELEASE??? WTF
@united still waiting a week later. Maybe it's time to switch to #americanairlines
What's going on with @deltaassist ? Three days in a row I have been put on hold for over 40 minutes and still haven't talked to anyone.
@AmericanAir YOU HAVE THE WORST SERVICE ALIVE. I HONESTLY THINK YOU DO NOT WANT MY MONEY.
@DeltaAssist hi you cancelled my flight and didn't rebook me. trying to call and your phones are down someone please DM me ASAP @eyalebel
@JetBlue Is WiFi fixed? No WiFi on my flight yesterday. Also they're playing "Union City Blue" by Blondie in my hotel lobby right now!
@CherFeldman @united please step it up! Grrr! Hope someone helps you soon.
@JetBlue great job adding bag fees and cutting leg room. That's Airline101 in how to go from being the best airline to becoming the worst!
@JensenAckles @AmericanAir aww poor Jensen should be over soon lol tell the man to chill out ðŸ˜‚
Over Four hours Delayed @AmericanAir ?! Seriously?! Why do I keep putting my son on your flights?! Hope @CodyLinley7 gets to DFW someday!!
Response from @americanair. Working lavatories are not a safety issue on a flight. Therefore can remain indefinitely unfixed. #shameful
She was hungry and crying? WTF ignorant and hateful staff @United  Is this a case of 'fear of autism'? http://t.co/yaoHJ9Po04 via @good
@AmericanAir flight 1049 was terrible today May 9th
@DeltaAssist how is 1702 already delayed 32 minutes for tomorrow AM's flight out of NY? crew timeout?
Frustrated with @SouthwestAir lack of comm at sdf this morning.  There is a maint issue and all they said was they have to "fly parts in"
@AmericanAir um.. I need your help... Upset customer here!
@southwestair does anyone ever answer the phone? Been on hold all day...
@amymarquez When @jmspool gets some place w/o an issue - drink. â€¦ Weâ€™d all die of thirst! @united
.@united You.Are.Lame. Book ticket w/points. Cancel flight. Charge me $125 to put my miles back in my bank. Seriously? That's sad.
@united flight 1745 Tha KS for screwing up my night with yet another delay from united.
@HardRockHotelSC @AmericanAir Flight from LA cancelled &amp; missing connection to Sioux City &amp; my show!! When does this become fun??ðŸ’€ðŸ”«
NEVER flying @united again. Booked window &amp; aisle seats in the same row. was given two middle seats 10 rows apart. Lots more. Avoid - awful
@AmericanAir it is extremely frustrating when you book a "Preferred Seat" to find out that it doesn't recline. DFW-SFO 17F next time tell me
@united I hope you keep your customer service reps promise and reimburse our family for their rental car after their flights were delayed!
@The_M_Machine @united whoa what the fuck?!
Delayed from 6:25 to 7:00 now 7:15 @SouthwestAir Please no more delay to #denver
Two late planes in a row. @AmericanAir is really shining today.
@DeltaAssist third day trying to reach delta by phone. email. twitter...still no response. never flying delta again..
@IIJERiiCHOII @VirginAmerica oh shit
@AmericanAir I can't believe how many times your people had lied to me! Never again I will flight in these company
@united #UA784 #delayed because your 1st officer is stuck in traffic!  You'd leave my ass if I were 20 minutes late-please spank this guy!
Yet again @united has provided the single worst customer service I have experienced in any industry. @Delta. my miles are yours.
Here's a shocker... @SouthwestAir with another delayed flight!  At least they are consistent...
@AmericanAir no we are still here waiting for a gate @ChicagoOHare very frustrating. happens every single time rain. sleet or snow. :(
@DLoesch @AmericanAir Ridiculous.
@united I thought my frustration would subside but the flight I was booking for $436 is now at $731. #unhappycustomer
@SouthwestAir is not only late but beyond slow. Gonna make me miss my connecting flight #clowns
@JetBlue Worst costumer service ever!
I am very tired of the inflight service of @AmericanAir  2 flts today and both FA's were bad.  I guess 90k miles YTD is nothing.  #ExecPlat
not been one of my better flight weeks.  Record: 1 on time. 3 delays. 1 cancellation.  Lots of ops/mech issues with @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir checked status. promised by 3. no call/delivery. I called back. 2 hrs on phone. told 2 pick up Pearson and  #RIDICULOUS
Ugggh @jetblue delays at jfk. Now getting home on a different day and lost my ride from the airport. #travelwoes #vacationsover
@united please don't strand us Hawaii-bound travelers in Newark! Stuck on tarmac at Logan and don't want to miss our connecting flight! 🙏
@AmericanAir how is it that someone called and canceled a ticket in my name and got a refund on a nonrefundable fare last night ?#nothappy
Why @united flights are always late?
@united that was a first. Being called to board. got to the plane. then told to go back and wait in the lobby. #frustrating #nocommunication
@united can literally NEVER get it together at @fly2ohare. Working on a 4 hour delay with a plane that's been sitting here for 10 hours.
.@CDCgov can I get Ebola from these disgusting @AlaskaAir seat cushions?
@AmericanAir can you possibly find my luggage? I have a claim put in. I've been told it was in philly. also that it never left buffalo
.@united has completely jumped the shark again. The manager at LGA is so unbelievably rude it’s not even funny.
Flight on @United to WY was worst ever. Now. a mechanical delay when they had all night to fix the problem. 45 min connect time in Denver.
@jetblue's flight status notifications work.   They called me three times to tell me my flight was delayed. :)
@Delta shameful unconscionable behaviour by gate agents!!!  Called @DeltaAssist. attempted sop of a paltry 500 miles in my Delta account.
FAA fines @SouthwestAir $328.550 for not inspecting plane after emergency landing and in 2nd case. not accurately logging repairs. @NBCDFW
@united I get there will be delays. take care of the passengers though.  Even an hour wait on plane at gate is horrible.
@AmericanAir I hope so too! That woman should not work with lost valuables if she can't handle understandable emotions and with the elderly!
@SouthwestAir my flight has been cancelled. I need help - been on hold for an hour!
@DeltaAssist I'm trying to..and STILL on hold
@mattcohen4real List of Airlines to avoid: @AmericanAir. @AlaskaAir.  Very unhappy flyers: @jarpad. @JensenAckles and now @mattcohen4real
Never fly @united. Romantic break to NYC and all my favourite things stolen from my bag on the journey home to London. #Heartbroken
@united. Just had the worst travel experience of my life with LAX United. Rude. uncaring and hostile customer service. You should be ashamed
@DeltaAssist looks like we are stuck on the ground in Indy &gt; MSP.  Very close connection to San Fran.  #help
@united absolute poor customer service.  Flight comes in and my outbound is not going out.  No help at the Greensboro airport!  Arrrgh!!!ðŸ˜¡
@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad. but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded.
Just booked to head to #NMX! Got killer rates on @SouthwestAir - and can't wait to stay at @MGMGrand hotel again! #vegas #media
@AmericanAir our bags are stuck at dfw but NO ONE in the baggage area will answer the phone to get them on a plane
NEVER flying #UnitedAirlines @united again- cancelled 2 of my flights when friends are flying str8 into LGA/you could drive me 2 NY quicker
@CTAlex_ @united td bank stay on that bullshit smh!
A whole day waiting because the flight was canceled. and gave us another one that was already oversold!!! FUCK #UnitedAirlines @united ✊✊
Feel bad for @JetBlue customer service today. Your day can only get better! Still the best airline out there
terrible. terrible staff. missed our flight because of them. def not recommending them #americanairlines @AmericanAir 😡
@melaniebromley @VirginAmerica That would have been awkward as hell if she said no...
WIFI at 40.000ft &amp; 500mph on @SouthwestAir &lt;&gt; NO WIFI at 10ft &amp; 75mph on @Caltrain_News #BehindTheTimes #upgrade
So @SouthwestAir u left the spare part in Dallas and now u have delayed us another 2:30 hours - mdw to LGA this is silly
5 worst airlines in America and I'm not at all surprised that @united is in that list! #Aviation #Airlines  http://t.co/ZdUUEipGVd
@DeltaAssist What's going on with DL1106? We've been waiting to board for 20 minutes.
@MeghanButler @JetBlue I had the same problems during the sale the other day. Also problems with the iOS app.
@AmericanAir Been waiting since 7:30am for AA 2567.  No communication.  Still no word😡 #poorservice
@AmericanAir ORD-&gt;LSE flight.  I was warned about this.  Should have listened to everyone else you made upset in the past.
@DeltaAssist My flight DCA-LGA has been canceled and rescheduled 3 times today.  Now why can't I speak to anyone to cancel and get a refund?
@united waiting to board UA1671 which is already 40 minutes delayed b/c of a missing flight attendant. Really just figuring this out???
@SouthwestAir I LUV. but my patience is worn. First a three hour delay (not weather). then mechanical issues. then first officer timed out.
Porche Cayenne won't help me catch my connection in Minneapolis tonight. Maitenance &amp; a missed flight @DeltaAssist
@fakemikemulloy @AmericanAir Swing and a miss. by American Air. No balls. Two strikes.
@AmericanAir #silverlining I also see not being able to call @Uber or notify lived ones when I land after extended tarmac vacation. 
You know who loves sitting on the tarmac and not moving. @AmericanAir? Little kids.
Had the worst flight EVER on @JetBlue today. It was so hot on the plane that even w/ the air blowing on me I passed out. Never flying again!
@AmericanAir @jmelynnschu Absolutley the worst airline service I've encountered in my life....Constant gate changes rude ticket agents SUCK!
@TheMattEspinosa @AmericanAir they lost all of my luggage once ðŸ˜
Sat on full @DeltaAssist flight to SXSW w/ planeload of Twitter-savvy digital ppl. 90+ mins delayed. Social customer care doomsday! ðŸ˜
.@united Still waiting in Panama City for loss suitcase #620380
What's the point of being A-list preferred if I NEVER get cleared off stand by @SouthwestAir
My @USAirways flight is hot as hell. No air conditioning since auxiliary power is turned off but apparently @AmericanAir needed the parking
I've never lost a bag flying @united...  I take a chance and fly @AmericanAir and they lose my bag as soon as I give it to them!
Love flying @VirginAmerica but they could do better with sustainability. Styrofoam cups and mini plastic water bottles? Not cool. #flygreen
@AmericanAir stunningly horrendous service by Tammy at counter for flight 148 out of Charlotte today. #appalling #investigate
@AmericanAir .... My family and I are stuck in Florida after we were refused passage because my 11 year old son has a nut allergy... Awful
@united just sent me a $50 voucher for losing my bags on both ends of my trip even though I was also delayed on both ends of trip. #losing
@DeltaAssist Hello. I am a Silver mbr in the midst of a lengthy mechanical delay - DL 5214 - ~2+hr delay. Is there compensation available?
@united downgraded my first class ticket to coach. told me to go on website for refund. still no response! Can someone PLEASE get back to me
The @united #friendlysky is when you get stuck in Chicago without rebooking or any other #service . #onourwaytovacation
@united When is a cancelled flight not cancelled?
@JetBlue Having trouble with my app. Technical issues?
@united also still waiting on my luggage! What better way to spend my Sunday? #unitedairlines #badservice
I hate @united they gave me a middle seat when I specifically ask for window or ale online when ordering my ticket 😬😬😬
You suck. @AmericanAir
@united ...you suck
. @AmericanAir and in Latin America? Will these #newbirds fly there? Our 9 hr flight was horrible due to a crappy plane #disapointedcustomer
@SouthwestAir way to go with all the Cancelled flights out of #MDW today. #worstservice #SouthWestAirlines is the worst
@deltaassist what exec in charge of #customerservice?  Theyd get a D as I was told wait times r 4 HOURS on phone!!  Industry std is 1 min.
@DeltaAssist I will be flying @AmericanAir business class from now on because your customer service was horrible.
@united as soon as I arrived despite being promised that the mistake made would be amended. It was not but made worse by losing the tag.
.@united Time for my aunts funeral: 20+hrs in the airport waiting for united. 13hrs sleeping. 20hrs with family. #unitedrecordprofits
The flight I'm about to take doesn't have internet. @united it's 2014 what in the fuck are you thinking?
@AmericanAir Delayed for 45 mins to fix AC...sigh #missingconnection #missingdinnermeeting  but should #makeitforthespeech
Uh why is my previously confirmed flight itinerary no longer showing up online?? @JetBlue what's happening right now?
@united Hi! I forgot to book using my United Mileage Plus Visa card and had to pay to check a bag. Any way to get it refunded. or too late?
@united don't worry I won't be flying united again. one week with two terrible trips was enough
@southwestair It's really bullshit that you cancel flights at the threat of snow
@AmericanAir weather delays are understandable. total chaos is not. No one is in charge here. Still waiting to check in 1.5 hrs later at OGG
Damn @SouthwestAir. You delaying my flight to NYC is making me miss @chrissyteigen at @lordandtaylor #nyc #delayedflight #lgastinks
Here's a new one. My #Delta flt498 is delayed because we're waiting for the cleaners to show up. Come on @DeltaAssist you can do better!
@SouthwestAir you really do get what you pay for. A shitty twice delayed flight with poor flight attendants and no sympathy for customers.
@Snugzmeow @DeltaAssist I wish social media existed then. I would have raised hell lol. Miss our flight because the gate attendant left
@united still waiting ....
.@United: What the hell? You say you found the bag yesterday. Why hasn't it been delivered it to my dad's hospital room? (Claim # FSD17028M)
15 minutes and I had to hang up @AmericanAir why are call wait times so long? Bad weather? #ExecutivePlatinum
@AmericanAir now learning what NFL knows: don't mess with @MichelleDBeadle. She has a bigger fan base for a reason. https://t.co/0cqvX27XnD
If @AmericanAir hadn't FUCKED ME last. hadn't given away my seat. I would've been around to get @DailyShow tickets. I hate you so much AA.
So @united boarded us on the wrong plane. Instead of switching planes. we sat for 1.5 hrs while they did paperwork #theworst #getmehome
I get to the airport at 6:45 for a flight that was delayed til 7:50. or so I thought. #Southwest #wtf @southwestair http://t.co/IlZsjBX0Pe
Less than 24 hrs after our flight was delayed two hrs. @JetBlue sends a $50 credit per person without us asking. Wow. I'm floored.
So @AmericanAir you might want to get someone at the baggage desk for the dozen people whose bags you've lost at ORD http://t.co/cFSfqbomld
@JetBlue what’s the best email address to contact someone about True Blue? 20+ minute phone wait right now. cc: @cminutella1
Flight delayed . Yay @united 😏
Beautiful week in Disney only to have my @JetBlue flight cancelled because JFK airport is retarded and has one runway open for construction.
@VirginAmerica not able to log into my elevate account. Issues with the site?
@ABC It appears @united employees have a fear of autism.
@united As a 1k flyer I am becoming more disappointed with United. Why no Aloha feeling on flights to Hawaii anymore???
@jilljubs never. I got more perk in 1 year of flying @SouthwestAir than 4 of flying @USAirways.
@SouthwestAir I would be. but delayed!
@AmericanAir due to crew tardiness &amp; ice. missed connection in DFW. My first class ticket is now coach. I assume I'll get a partial refund?
Big shout out to @united 4 completely screwing all my travel plans. It's not like I had 2 buses. a train. and campground booked #neveragain
Delays = a hotel and me being late to work tmw will require a call to @AmericanAir to discuss. Least I have wine... http://t.co/Dg8tONjeES
Bummer @SouthwestAir - boarded plane in Vegas only to be told there's a mechanical issue and now we have to sit here for an hour.
Guess who has two thumbs and will never use @Orbitz or fly @united any time soon?
@united SUCKS
@DeltaAssist 1st a 45 min call wait &amp;no one ever came on phone; then it took about a month for me to get a response to ? I submitted online
I have been sitting on my plane not moving for almost an hour I am very annoyed @AmericanAir
@Hertz 7 days since my claim and I have not a response. I require only reverse U$468 that I was forced to buy with lies. @JetBlue Help!
@SouthwestAir what is the reason for flight 634 HRL TO HOU delayed 2 hours?
@AmericanAir y'all made @bryanteslava miss his flightðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ wtf
Obligatory weekly tweet about United sucking in every phase of the game. Followed by the weekly #sorrynotsorry response from @United. #fb
@AlaskaAir we are on the plane. waiting for THE PILOTS TO ARRIVE. WUT
@Delta @DeltaAssist 2 out of last 3 flights - broken headset jack - time to switch to @united
@United please respond to complaint Case ID # 8601221 - hoping to hear back at earliest convenience  &gt;&gt;&gt;  danielsevern@live.com

After a snack less 4 hour flight. we are stuck on the runway. Starrrrrving @VirginAmerica!!!!!
@AmericanAir Flight US0619 delayed because a flight attendant hasn't showed up. Your service couldn't be worse.
@HoodieAllen @Delta @DeltaAssist it's BECAUSE THEY'RE DELTA AIRLINES WHERE LIFE IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE
@SouthwestAir can you please explain why my 9:40 to abq (#814) was cancelled but all the other flights were just delayed til 10?
Shame on you @united:  LONG-HAUL economy configuration w/ rows of 10 seats instead of current 9: http://t.co/dGibiCfi3t #greedy
@DeltaAssist delayed again on the ground for no reason. what options do I have for later flights if I miss my connection? HZTVP4
Flight delayed 2 hours coming to Vegas. now say on plain for 1.5 hours going home. Real great service @jetblue
My @united flight to Berlin is delayed. Surprise. 7 of my 9 flights in the past two months were delayed. Is it like that with every airline?
Been on hold for 4 hours w/ @AmericanAir - US Air- customer service need help! Longest customer service call in my 50+ year life.
@SouthwestAir please remind people to check the seat back so they don't leave their ipod in the seat back and never get it back:((
No @JetBlue please. take your time. We've only been sitting on the runway waiting to take off for what seems like a day. #ugh #jetblue
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for making us wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes at the gate
. @SouthwestAir ridiculous delays right now. Past 3 flights I've taken with SW have had delays. @JetBlue looks better &amp; better every time..
@JetBlue Smooth move. kicking that woman off the flight. People like me who travel a lot will be sure to avoid your flights.
@datachick I had my flight cancelled this morning but at least @United already booked me and gave me seats an the best option back home.
Hey @Delta. I know delays happen but seriously. what the heck is going on? @DeltaAssist http://t.co/FWWX20XypY
:-( RT @Dert39er: In DEN trying to get back earlier to MSP for my 15 year wedding anniversary $267 to change ...unhappy! @SouthwestAir
@xcourtneyyy_ they've told us 3 times our flight is on time. It's now 1 hr 25 mins past our departure time. Fuck you @Delta u 2 @DeltaAssist
@VirginAmerica only 1 leg of my journey was cancelled - will the complete trip be rebooked? on hold on phone b/c was not clear on the email.
@AmericanAir @Angela_Stanford Do airlines understand that players would rather have their suitcase delayed rather than their clubs?
@AmericanAir ruined my day
@AmericanAir terrible airline. Answer your phone! I am going home for a family emergency http://t.co/IHezCr7rZt
@J_enb @AmericanAir not as upset as me!!!!! 😭
@SouthwestAir so what happens if my wallet got stolen? How do I get back home without my I.d. ? ðŸ˜­
Without fail. every flight I take to or from #SanFrancisco on @SouthwestAir is always delayed #annoyed
@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since. when do I get it back?
@JetBlue flight delayed due to a paperwork issue?
@richardmarx @united my dads retired from UA. What's happened??Used to be the BEST airline! Sorry. that's awful!!
You guys r a dam joke your services can suck my dick @SouthwestAir
@united 30 day wait for you to tell me if you found my daughters pillow and baby blanket? You try living 30 days with an upset child! #angry
@AmericanAir yet another delay AA1212. exec plat customer sorely disappointed. @Delta i might come calling
Currently on hold for @AmericanAir for 40 min + counting b/c my flight is cancelled! Should have flown @SouthwestAir http://t.co/x33Fzx55Mi
@SouthwestAir OMG!! The first attendant from HELL!!!! Rudest attendant I've ever met.
@united can you plz help me understand the details of flt 6336 delay? #unitedairlines need to make conn flt 1571 in sf
@AmericanAir was just told we have to sit on the plane (with a broken restroom?!) for at least 45 min. AA 2874
Can't board until we have all crew members. one still has not reported. Already delayed 1 hour and half. C'mon @united
Darn it @SouthwestAir you damaged my $4900 carbon frame &amp;tell me i transport at my own risk. Needs to be a solution. http://t.co/b5doOBF4xt
@AlaskaAir Thank John. As a long time AK air customer its just a bummer that most of my flights to and from SFO get delayed. 1/2
@rach3lknight @AmericanAir I legit almost snatched one of their employees for being a bitch after they fucked me over.
@DeltaAssist no availability? Not sure what that means. My handle was all there when I rolled it up to check in. Now. broken &amp; missing stuff
So disappointed in @JetBlue #whyshouldibeloyal #dontchange #dontchargeforbags  http://t.co/3kaK85vSK3
@TurkishAirlines and @united are just playing the #blame game with me. Nobody trying to help me out. #Worst #airline #experience
k @united we REALLY need to talk - sent from purgatory. aka the tarmac at the wrong airport 4 hrs after I was supposed to be home
Shame on you @SouthwestAir This is disgusting. I hope that heartless FLT attendant has flown her last flight. http://t.co/bwI1QNoN8h
@AmericanAir I show up w/ a certified therapy animal. a pregnant wife. and you treat us like lying. cheating. thieves. #pathetic #greed RT
@JetBlue Are there problems with online checkin? The iPhone app wouldn't complete and online I was able to checkin but not companion.
@AlaskaAir delayed flights and items missing from my checked bag. :(
.@united (2/5) Even though the delay was due to crew issues. I get $7 for a meal and 1 "sorry". In a world where customer loyalty goes to
.@DeltaAssist another delay? This happens way too often with you. Please DM me so we can discuss
Olivia hanging out at JFK @AmericanAir Admirals Club awaiting her flight to @HeathrowAirport This toddler rocks. http://t.co/GC1TaEOTph
&lt;--- mad as hell at @SouthwestAir for the 4-hour delay that prevented Tom from joining us for Chris' birthday dinner at @ChezMelange.
1 cancellation and 3 delays later. I'm never flying @JetBlue again.
@AmericanAir American Airlines deserves the name.  They're really that shitty.
@united one of your ground stewardess in HNL failed to listen when we said our final destination was YYZ and now our carry-on check-in is ..
Totally insane that @SouthwestAir got $25 out of me for B37 &amp; 38. There should be a limit on EarlyBird tickets. So much for no fees.
@DeltaAssist @Delta shame on you. You really failed me today. You too @LGA but I'm used to that by now. I'd rather go to EWR and fly @united
@JetBlue fuck you.
@united your seats are literally falling apart. It fell forward as I sat down. u should be ashamed #imoverreacting http://t.co/RJ6zNBsCzL
@aayoub @Remroum @Delta @DeltaAssist would they have put a #WASP to the back of the plane after being harassed?
@JetBlue Any explanation as to why TrueBlue points for 3/20 flights are still not up?  Mosaic support seemed irritated when I asked.
@AmericanAir will do. I can't wait for a single reservations system. code share tickets are crap. and US or AA can't help. Just blank stare.
@united airlines. Why do you flat out lie. The info below is not true and it has passed the timelines. http://t.co/5fuBtbVKVU
@AlaskaAir I keep flying w/u in hopes that you will treat ur customers better &amp; I'm starting 2 realize it's never going 2 happen #sadbuttrue
DL 4521 another Sky West mechanical they can't fix! Supposed to be in Dallas. @DeltaAssist
Really disappointed with @united for +6hrs of delays and poor communication for 50k miles and $200
Being told you cannot check into your flight online the night before a 24hr flight - Not a good start to the trip home @VirginAmerica
@united this is the 3rd time my flight to SFO has been delayed 2+ hrs. Is this a typical United problem? I would like an upgrade please.
@AmericanAir There is a problem with the website trying to use miles to book hotels.  It keeps taking me to aavacations not redeem miles.
@MoonshineBnanza @AmericanAir still playing the waiting game?
@AmericanAir I've now been on hold for an hour...would I have more luck going to the airport and actually speaking to someone there?
@AmericanAir it is unbelievable that almost always your flights are delay.
Lots of issues w/@AmericanAir website now...keep getting error msgs when trying to book...
@AmericanAir what the hell does "baggage not located yet" mean??? How can it not be known where it went
UNACCEPTABLE. @united please remedy this.  https://t.co/O8qqs7z226
I thought we were friends @VirginAmerica ...2 1/2 hour delays for runway repairs... How didn't we know!
another @SouthwestAir flight. another WiFi at dial-up speed. 800-series 737. think this wouldnt be issue. #Luv the airline. hate the #WiFi
@united every time I fly United my flight is either delayed or my bags are lost. Coincidence? #stuckinperu
@deltaassist what's the status of flight 452 for today 2-15-15. If is cancelled when is reschedule.
Being delayed is not @united fault. Being screwed around on rebooking is. I'd have more chance to contact the dead
@JetBlue my delta flight from JFK to MSY airport keeps getting delayed any way you can hook me up and get me on the JFK to MSY 4:20 flight
Longg morning @dfwairport. Runway closed bec drainage issue &amp; @AmericanAir changed our gate twice &amp; now can't find a plane
Epic fail @united and @iah parked at gate and jet bridge doesn't work. Now have to be towed to new gate.
@AmericanAir why does baggage delivery @dcairports DCA routinely take half an hour with poor digital displays?
@united your services at Newark airport are terrible and im tired of only running into such problems with your airline.
Help me. @deltaassist — missing MQMs and MQDs on recent flight!
After broken aircraft &amp; 6 hours getting dicked around by @united airlines. you won't catch me flying thru #ohare or on #unitedairlines again
@AmericanAir disappointed at the lack of cross ever privileges between aa and us air. 4 hour flight with family spread out all over plane
100% of my @united flights have been delayed.
@AmericanAir over 1 year more than half of my flights have been late to depart and arrive.  Worse bc most are out of DFW you home hub
Attempting to book through @Delta is nearly impossible. on hold for over an hour. yet to speak w/rep @DeltaAssist http://t.co/m7FuQCPgMm
Sitting in first class near one of the absolute worst behaved children I have ever seen. This should be fun......@VirginAmerica
@AmericanAir  after waiting in line for 1 hour. two 30min phone calls. all I know is that my bag. along with over 300. is unaccounted for
@united 4.5hr flight and the only food offering in First is a fucking bag of pretzels? Remind me why I should continue to give you money.
@MatthewLush @JetBlue TELL HER TO SUCK MY ASS
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 30 min trying to rebook my flight you cancelled. Help?!
@AmericanAir On flight 2345 delayed for 1.5 hours on tarmack due to multiple maintanence issues &amp; missing my connection to SFO. Solutions?
First @AmericanAir flight in a while and last for a while. Ridiculous preventative maintenance delays on their first flight of the day.
@AmericanAir AA flight 91 from london - delayed 2 hours - come on American !  You stink. Stop putting us on old broken 767s
@virginamerica need to change tonight's flight. won't let me do it online. Call Center says the wait time is over 1 hour - is this correct?
@chrisdelia @united i woulndt know. I never fly their shitty airline.
@AmericanAir I have a question: how is it that you delay the flight. because the plane is out of order. And when asked if we can just
Well. I guess there's no reason for me to fly @JetBlue anymore now that they're trying to be like all the other airlines I no longer fly.
@SouthwestAir it's still not working for him! Might want to send a credit.
@DeltaAssist 6 hours delay then cancelled flight yesterday. Then endless delay again today. And this time this is NOT the weather!
After 48hrs of bullshit (thanks @AmericanAir) I am finally on a @SouthwestAir flight that's actually getting me to my destination!!!!!! ✈️✈️
Normally fly @united. had to fly @USAirways today. No comparison. Bad equipment. angry employees. What a disaster of a company.
@DeltaAssist I paid for economy comfort but you switched me to a regular seat. How do I get a refund? Conf no. 0060143068288 Zenner
@united look again at last two lines on that page-you penalize members going to Hawaii &amp; worse you penalize Premier members w/co-pay! $500?
@united I'm crying. We will lose $644 if we cancel our cruise but it costs too much to get the tickets. This is nuts. :(
&amp;I thought my 2hr hold was bad. @AmericanAir #FAIL “@TIME: American Airlines left this passenger on hold for 6 hrs http://t.co/8XVepXiw71”
So @VirginAustralia &amp; @DeltaAssist #ruin my trip; ignore all #emails #calls &amp; #tweets and. as customers. we are supposed to just take it⁉️
Pro tip for @united: never make presumption about what you think is "initial post." Read back thru timeline juuust a little  e.g. @aloria
@SouthwestAir Currently in flight from EWR to PHX.  Connecting to LAX. 8KQ6ST. Looks like we will arrive too late.  Help!
@united Delayed for 3+ hours with very little updates or information. no concern for the passengers. no food vouchers...  #sheesh
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@DeltaAssist Whats the benefit of skymiles if I can't reserve a seat on flight without having to paying extra?  Cancelling my AmexSkymiles.
@AmericanAir F class stinks so bad. I'm guessing if Advantage ever goes revenue based AA loses boat loads of frequent flyers
.@JetBlue really testing the penmen patience right now. 4 hour delay. board the plane. leave the gate. go back to the gate.. Brutes
@united Painfully slow machines that don't read my card are bad.  Reps that walk away midsentence when I can't check in are worse.
@DeltaAssist  stuck in ATL trying to go home to BOS.  Rerouted to MPS today.   Any direct flights avail Monday to BOS?  2-16??
And now all JFK bound @AmericanAir flights out of LAX are all delayed. It appears JFK airport is a total cluster fuck today.
Shame on you. @united. https://t.co/qhcKQexZlD
@AmericanAir 2nd break down in 2 flights missing my transfer flight and a day's work 👎
Really @AmericanAir 12+ hr flight and only 12 movies all that look terrible. Why did I have more selection ord to sfo than pek to ord?
@americanair did you know the average family spends approx 6 hrs on hold waiting for you to answer phone when flights are cancelled? Wtf
@AlaskaAir maybe you can pay for my hotel in Maui since your flight 805 is delayed over 3.5 hrs. I'm out 250 and a 1/2 day vacation! Thxs!
@Delta @DeltaAssist I am very unhappy!!
Hey @AmericanAir. we've been sitting at the gate at DCA for an hour on 6 AM flight to Miami. People missing connections. Sort it out!
@united why don't you turn off the lights for longer on overseas flights? @Lufthansa_DE does!
Okay. can we just discuss how terrible the new @united safety video is?!  Someone should be fired.
@AmericanAir flight cancelled. moved to another. want to cancel. It says call.. it's been hours. Worst is that online cancel isn't allowed.
#VEDay70 celebration in DC means mass flight delays and cancellations #nothelpful @DeltaAssist @AmericanAir #DC #fail
I wasn't able to thank @jetblue for the 2.5 hour tour of JFK's tarmac yesterday_y'all were fast asleep once I finally landed. at 2:30AM...
Being #mvpgold on a @Delta flight doesn't mean squat. Wish I had flown @AlaskaAir. Even if routing longer #alaskaair is better . FYI
Been on hold waiting to talk to someone at @AmericanAir  for 2.5 hrs! #CanceledFlights
@anildash @dweinberger at least we'll always have @united  inhuman. inhumane. they will never ride the cluetrain.
Bad form @Delta. @DeltaAssist &amp; @Gogo . Technical difficulties the whole flight. Attendant said WiFi is out of order. http://t.co/XBgy88QaVI
@SouthwestAir Disappointed today with the service at LUV today. 6+ hours delayed on Flight 470 and only 2 customer service agents to support
So flying @united instead of @Delta so far has been a huge disappointment &amp; the flight doesn't leave until Mon. Change fee is ridiculous
Very unhappy with @SouthwestAir no wifi on a flight that advertised wifi! Only reason I booked this flight during workday was cause I work
.@JetBlue it is unkind to not consider a connecting passenger headed to funeral when the prev flight got in w 15min to spare. #disappointed
@AmericanAir yes @united saved the day. but now I'm spending Christmas Eve in the Chicago airport because of AA. Time to switch airlines...
Hate landing and then sitting on the ground waiting for a gate.. C'mon @AlaskaAir this is a constant battle when landing here in Seattle!
@AmericanAir im in San Antonio and need to get to Jacksonville FL for a wedding latest  tomorrow morning.   other airline cancelled.  help!
Fly to DC tomorrow for http://t.co/BXkoVYiI3K. @united shows I am #3 on the upgrade wait list with 2 unsold seats in First. Oh the tension!
Pretty sure they delay flights just to keep the airport restaurants in business. Thanks a lot @JetBlue 
My @SouthwestAir flight is delayed 50 minutes and they wont let me switch to earlier one. why.
@SouthwestAir really needs to get their shit together. Another flight delay ðŸ˜‘ this is getting old ðŸ˜ 
@united IS THE FUCKING WORST AIRPLANE COMPANY •••
@SouthwestAir your phone lines suck. I have a dilemma.
@united i had my bag lost on GRU-EWR UA30 May 2nd . until now I got no answer from you when I will receive it. I am very  #unhappy #United
@SouthwestAir My friends are having the #worstdayever ... Their luggage is lost and Southwest won't even look for it #wherestheluv
@united It was my flight out of DCA that was cancelled and so I had to get myself to IAD.
@ColleenB123 @AmericanAir What the heck?? Why are airlines so useless these days?
Terrifying that I can better understand @SHERM8N's situation than @AmericanAir - who's actually IN the conversation. #poorcustomerservice
@JetBlue. will you reimburse for $20 taxi ride and $40 amtrak ticket needed due to your 3.5 hour delay? FYI Boston doesn't function 2a-5:30a
3rd flight cancelled this week. @AmericanAir.  Now have to fly United today. Guess you DON'T learn from mistakes as you assured me.
@DeltaAssist Issue was the gate agent at SLC to SEA flt 1857. Came from HNL without issue. Headed to ANC. Will
Hey @Delta. how come an on time arrival at 10pm on Sunday night has to wait 40 minutes for a gate?  Should have flown @VirginAmerica
@united just need real answers - flight delayed since 8 am
@united gonna miss 1066 EWR to BOS because of delays on 1532 from SAL. Potential solutions?
After a 3 hr delay to fix some non starting engines I'm hopefully on my way back to MDW @SouthwestAir #nowitsaredeye
@AmericanAir will never fly your airline again. Rude ticket agents.broken kiosks. multiple lines to stand in. #yourebroken
@AmericanAir now im delayed in TULSA? srsly this is one of the worst travel experiences ever. sticking with @SouthwestAir from now on.
I'm boarding @united back to USA from England. Please don't surround me by screaming kids again. Kisses
@Delta taking bags for a mandatory check way too early in ATL. Inconvenience too many ppl and further delay us. @SouthwestAir 4EVA.
@Burdmaan @SouthwestAir -- Yet another terrible experience flying Southwest. Extremely disappointed.
@AmericanAir. my friend's flight to Tampa cancelled. Trying to rebook but call center keeps saying try later. still no word. Pls advise!
@AmericanAir Had a bad flight experience with you. 2 days in a row. You expect your customer to put their bag here? http://t.co/G90MWNQ7lT
.@VirginAmerica I have a not so happy kid kicking my seat from behind &amp; someone else on the plane thinks it's #NationalFartDay - #HelpMeOut
Terrible customer service from @AmericanAir at kailua-kona #norespect #neveragain
@jarpad @JensenAckles @AlaskaAir Um. Alaska Air. don't mess with Mr. Padalecki's family. He won't be happy. Please help Mr. Ackles &amp; fix it.
Why @VirginAmerica? WHY is my password invalid?  Bad #UX. http://t.co/hLRCcPqP7z
@AmericanAir your lies about our delayed bag status ruined our holiday. instead of being w family we are waiting for your VERY late driver.
@AmericanAir gate agent NO HELP.  Customer's fault she missed flight? AA sent erroneous gate change alert! http://t.co/KTyPYiQxE7
@AmericanAir 24 hours later still no response AA cancel flight for a 22 year female Honduras-Miami+ never informed her @CNNTravel @#foxnews
It's been awhile but I'm back on @AmericanAir  and of course they are late.
@JetBlue flt 1701 gate rep could bother to turn her head to look at me when I'm trying to get info. Side eye is standard I guess?
Everyone on the plane except the co-pilot. Who is still 40 mins away from landing in Chicago. So now we wait. @United #newwaystobedelayed
@DeltaAssist this is the last and final insult. I'm platinum On dl427. There are 7 empty seats in delta one!!!! #KeepDescending shame on you
I really would appreciate some help from @JetBlue since my flight keeps getting delayed an hour at a time this afternoon
@BrusselsAirport @united very poor service updates and communication at lost baggage.
@SummerHandzlik @Delta I hate them. They're awful. @JetBlue for life
@united Told by agent M1152 I was confirmed on a flight to WA only to arrive @ airport to find out no booking exists. #UnitedAirlines #fail
_@CNNMoney: Next time you fly @JetBlue. better get ready for bag fees and cramped seats http://t.co/8yr80m7N33 http://t.co/g0dTkKxfbY_ Noooo
Really unhappy with @united for their lack of cooperation trying to find my lost Macbook. It's so important to get back &amp; they don't care.
@PaytonTaylor129 @SouthwestAir The nightmare of bad weather.
@DeltaAssist no. lets have this convo in public. You changed flight 3 hrs. Now I have to stay an extra night. #Fail.
@deltaassist I received a call that my flight has been switched &amp; now I am not with my original party. What # can I call for help?
@JetBlue thanks for the update and well wishes. kept getting delayed but eventually got there. crappy weather :(
@stephenfry @AmericanAir @united Lost your bags too?
Why is this @SouthwestAir Wi-Fi SO SLOW?! $8 for my internet to move like I'm using a dial-up connection?! Come on. man.
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@AmericanAir please help you have stressed me to no end today
My traceable bags have been lost for hours now. @SouthwestAir. what gives? I miss having clothes that fit!
Another @AmericanAir flight. another delay. Situation normal #DFW No flight attendants was reason given for delay. http://t.co/gzGFxC3mRf
@airfarewatchdog @SouthwestAir Why are Southwest flights from Albuquerque to Vegas more than Newark to Vegas??!! Frustrating!!!
@united why did u make ppl wait when you knew there would be staffing issues...
@united you better not have a mechanical on that 757-200. Most unreliable plane in your fleet!
Flew @united today - Luggage was broken and ripped in several places. New xmas toys for our toddler were broken. Unimpressed.
@AmericanAir your numbers w/ me last 2 weeks: 2 flights canceled (1 int). 1 delayed. 2 lost baggage. 4 days without clothes. Unbelievable.
Outraged by the abuse of yet another Muslim in this country. This time a Chaplain from NWU @United  Shame! Shame! Shame!#unitedfortahera
.@united UA 6051. Delayed nearly 2 hours by weather somewhere. Get to spend 4+ hrs at IAD. Now FA copping attitude with everyone. #nothappy
@SouthwestAir stuck at SFO since 6AM. hungry and tired. and Disneyland isn't happening today anymore bc of 2 consecutive cancelled flights
@AmericanAir even though we have gone through multiple planes and mechanical failures the flight crew is stellar flt119 to Maui
After canceling 3 flights switching seat I paid x$50 from aisle to window &amp; leaving me w/out my bag for 3 extra days @united gives me points
@JetBlue your customer service is a joke #flight1201 #delayed #delayed #delayed
@SouthwestAir I have already mailed my claim. along with all the receipts and photos for all the items you lost. Words can't describe how
@AmericanAir back finally came one day later. Your customer service is terrible.
Incompetence at its finest this evening from @JetBlue. A combined thanks to them and Ma Nature for yet another miserable travel experience.
Hey @united if I was re-routed by LH on one of your flights and the UA1123 was late. who do I contact for compensation?
No wifi on a @jetblue flight that was promoting wifi :( if jetblue can't get it customer service right. what American airline can we trust?
@SouthwestAir your WiFi is the WORST in the entire industry - can't get anything done on your flights @USAirways @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir
@aayoub @roqchams shame on @Delta @DeltaAssist
@DeltaAssist Your reservation system is killing me. 5th attempt to book flight this week.Some prob w/ KLM fails res. Now price went up #grrr
@JetBlue Pls confirm the current status of flt #916 &gt; SFO to JFK. Received two conflicting messages. Delayed or not?
It's a damn shame my brother-in-law has been on hold with @DeltaAssist for over 2 hours. Decent lounge music though.
I now remember why I hate flying @AmericanAir #internationally no invididual tv screens in economy #whatajoke never again american airlines
Hey @DeltaAssist any chance you could give my wife a call back? She missed your call back and is on a short break. #CustomerService #dayjob
@united my friends are having a hell of a time getting their suitcase from newark to toronto that you stranded there two days ago. any help?
@DeltaAssist Hi! I need to cancel a flight by midnight tonight have called 3x + waited for return calls that havent come. Dont want penalty.
After cancelled @united flight. then replacement flight being delayed 4 TIMES. we have now been sitting on the runway in Denver for an hour.
@united our flight is delayed now and we only have 25 minutes to make our connecting flight. Is there another flight we can use as plan b?
@thekapman Aren't you glad a marketing person from @AmericanAir was able to give you operational reasons for your delay? #callingBS
@VirginAmerica Still waiting on a response to my status match submission. I have a flight coming up on 12/4. Can you assist with an update?
@DeltaAssist flight was suppose to leave at 10 it is now 1648. only thing we had to apologize was subway sandwiches. 6inches not toasted...
JFK to IAD with @JetBlue. Off to #WashingtonDC for the day. #delayed http://t.co/BTiiptFmpb
@VirginAmerica overall I like flying you.  But why is the wifi so bad?  It's not unreliable; it's reliably terrible. yet super expensive.
Made two attempts to book a flight on my phone but the site was experiencing URL problems then called @JetBlue and gave up after 45 min wait
wtf??? $200 to change a fligth for an earlier one??? @AmericanAir sucks!
@Summertimejill @d_drager @michaellew10 @swehlatrucking @bjonescfp We will if we ever take off!! 50 minute delay on @AmericanAir #greatstart
Smh. I hate you so much @United
Can't believe @AmericanAir has not gotten back to me in over 12 hours about my luggage that did not arrive!!! #annoyed
@AmericanAir the issue is now resolved but the policy is problematic. I understand the business reasons but recommend a rethink
My god. Fucking STOP! RT@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/9InzByNWqgâ€l
Waited 9 minutes on hold and got hung up on by @united -_-
@united the "tag your own bag" program you have at @iah terminal B is the worst thing I've ever seen.  I hope you drop it quickly.
@thomasaugusto @AmericanAir that shit! How so? ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
@JetBlue it's always great when the captain is missing... I'll be impressed through if we leave BOS this morning.
@jetblue.  DUDES:  BIG MISTAKE MESSING WITH LEG ROOM. I HAVE BEEN SO LOYAL TO YOUR AIRLINE BUT NOW WORRIED I CAN'T FIT.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold for over an hour... What is the problem.
@united cancelled my flight to LAX with no notification and can't get me there for 5 hours and I have a meeting at 9.
Brutal 4AM wake up. Long day of travel. Thankfully I have @Starbucks &amp; @united  #seat1B
My @united flight delayed over 2 hrs while they replace an exit light. I'm done. Never flying #UnitedAirlines ever again. #bs
@AmericanAir Known issue with booking US Airways flights on http://t.co/tgRNIjNKwI is a waste of your customers' time. Please fix this!
It smells like someone is peeing on a can of burning tuna fish on this plane. @united. Flight 1527. http://t.co/3LcANW63Xw
Sitting on @AmericanAir 563 for the past hour waiting for catering? Are you kidding me? It was already supposed to leave at 5:05!
Second flight delayed by @SouthwestAir!!!! You guys are the best
Four flights in five days ain't fun but when you get bumped up to the pointy end it's not bad. Thanks @AlaskaAir! #frequentflying
@AmericanAir Trying to book a flight for hrs &amp; keep getting an error msg. Finally talk to Web Tech who was quite rude and condescending. :(
view frm d worst seat onboard wasn't bad. Lost my pref seat due 2 flight delays @AmericanAir #americanway http://t.co/Li8wFPunUj
Dear @JetBlue today you lost my loyalty as a customer. I will now fly whoever is cheapest. Welcome to the #scumbagair club.
@AmericanAir I rec'd this unacceptable response. Cannot email the acct &amp; no phone # to call. How can I resolve this? http://t.co/9fd02kRMtv
@JetBlue despite a 3+ hr delay last night. we had a fantastic flight JFK-&gt;PBI.  Please thank your amazing crew members Taylor and Fabien!
American Airlines flight from Dallas to LAX delayed then bumped down to a smaller plane. Ugh! Bummer. #EpicFail @AmericanAir
@united how is a plane that is already late forced to sit on the Tarmac waiting for an open gate? over an hour late. You guys suck.#EWRtoJAX
delayed in El Paso by @united trying to get to Houston... something about a landing light broke... ETA still unknown :(
@AmericanAir is the worst.
@AmericanAir shame on the boarding agent in IAD who wouldn't  let us board early w/my autistic son even though gate agent said we could.
Last time I fly @Jetblue 35 mins take off delay. 2 hour #ForcedLayover &amp; now we arrived 3 hrs after expected arrival time! #NoTvs #NoDrinks
@robkatz @AmericanAir Only going to get worse. @USAirways is destroying the AA brand...no employee moral = crappy customer service
Going into hour 4 on the Tarmac with @SouthwestAir at #BWI with 3 little kids. I think this is Dante's second circle. #freedrinks #please
@VirginAmerica the code ESCAPE20 is not working on the site. supposed to be good until the end of Sunday....
I will never use @united again! 3 hour delay and not accommodating what-so-ever! Get your crap together!
@Sia @united @theregoesbabs I will never fly united again either. I will only fly an airline who will treat an animal as if it were a human.
@DeltaAssist Seriously?  Morning flight delayed due to mechanical. evening flight canceled.  No comp. nothing for a PM?  What the? #CXfail!
@united #unitedwithivy I was treated badly with this terrible airline 2 yrs ago. Will NEVER fly them again. #worstintheworld #unitedisugly
@AmericanAir every time I fly with you I never get to my destination on time...
After our flight was delayed for several hours we're still sitting here in #NYC @JetBlue first captain is MIA.
@AmericanAir @USAirways can't believe how terrible you are
@jbbreazeale @united you booked a 33 min layover on Xmas eve? That's your problem
@united #UA3764 #epicfail 60 mins trying to fix an issue only to turn back mid flight... I'm losing confidence in UA http://t.co/kXAB8G7JDe
@VirginAustralia No response? :( Sigh... @DeltaAssist replies quickly &amp; fixes things. Had aisle seat. not now. Full flight. What happened?
@delta @DeltaAssist Delta should be ashamed. Firing Kip Hedges shows zero class. and I will never fly Delta again.
.@AmericanAir So. CustRelats entirely unsatisfactory. No dialogue-standard response only. Not entering details for 3rd time. What now?
@AmericanAir screws a broke college kid ( @Justinfouts ) out of $90 for a hotel room due to a malfunctioning plane #seriously #ridiculous
@CMAPoole @DeltaAssist 30 business days! What a fucking joke!
@JetBlue Trying! Site's broken. :(
@jasonWSJ @JetBlue I am assuming no TV means free cocktails all around.
@JetBlue any reported issues with the app? It keeps crashing when I try to get my boarding pass.
@VirginAmerica hey there! I'm having issues with this promo.
@united big metal box under my seat?It's 8 hour flight can't even stretch my legs. Never fly UA int'l #lowbudget http://t.co/3613YprpS4
Disappointed in @AmericanAir customer service. No follow up. no number to call. no bueno #customerservice #helpagirlout #callmemaybe
I have never used Twitter in my life but I am just because of what @jetblue is doing to my wife and I first trip to NY. #jetbluewhy
Another @united flight another delay! Why do I keep flying #united airlines ?
Really wondering if I should switch to @united  after @AmericanAir changed Gold status member benefits with their advantage program.
Is there anyone at @united that can simply help me use my travel certificate online to book a flight? Shouldn't be on hold this many times.
@JetBlue you suck for canceling flight 1273 way to ruin my weekend #JetBluesucks
@JetBlue in SEA-TAC waiting to check in for an international flight but there is no check in attendant. Please help!
"@JackDail: this flight is so shitty I feel like puking @united"
Lmao fuck @united airlines and their discriminatory shit. Regardless of it was a patron who said the rudest part. YOU instigated it. Shame.
@united Cannot check in online. Your page just refreshes instead of taking me to my account. Hope I don't miss my flight because of this!
@Chris_Chmura @united problem with that is they're offering to make the situation better by inviting me to spend hundreds of $$$ with them
Bad move. @united. Bad move. http://t.co/BD7PzJcKi0
This is bad business @united  #Canada #USA @Oprah  @TheEllenShow  https://t.co/lmdrhqj6Zw
@Feelmyflow @SouthwestAir @AlaskaAir agreed. I had a two hour delay this week. with southwest. no service then either
.@AmericanAir this is the error I'm getting when trying to book ANY codeshare flight on JAL.  Clearly an issue http://t.co/tRe5yTAUwT
@DeltaAssist Have been on hold for 20 minutes. Trying to get my Delta app account unlocked. Flying in the morning. Help please?
@united no response to my request 18357809- please update me
@VirginAmerica yes I would like to file a complaint!
@VitalyKroy yeah you look like a big dude. That would suck indeed. I try to always fly @SouthwestAir so I generally can pick my seat mates
Why not to fly @AmericanAir: flight just cancelled 2 hrs before takeoff.
@PzFeed Note to self: never fly @JetBlue. Thanks for making that decision easy. #protest #Justice4All #boycott
@madisonrenee7 @AmericanAir I had the same issue
No way in hell a round trip for two should be almost $2000 idgaf if it IS a holiday weekend. @SouthwestAir
DELAYED + missing connection = SUCKS! After 1hr on hold w/ @united. my issue is resolved. Be at #PBRBIL w/time for a nap.
@AmericanAir POOR EXPERIENCE 2day at ord chkin. 8 emp. w/3 cust. 10 waiting. Asked to speak w/supervisor. Told 20 min. In a mtg!! What?!?!
@AmericanAir even followed me. but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer "service". Ever. #customerservice #fail
@united over 4 hr delay on flight 903 and no communication on the latest hold up.
OMG! On @americanair from Zurich to JFK &amp; there’s no private screens only cabin ones!! Should have paid more &amp; flown @British_Airways #fail
@OJessicaNigri @SouthwestAir Fuck me what did they do drag it behind the plane????
Please protect me for my now inevitable missed connection in Denver @united.  I9WMNV. New planes should not be mechanical for over an hour.
@united Last nights flight 1557 had NO snacks and ran out of food halfway. NO WARNING. UNACCEPTABLE! VERY displeased! 6 hours hungry!
@united BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE in Houston Airport. Delighted flight. lost conection. no hotel to stay the night.
@marlenam9 @united wtf you tagged them! What if they decide to some OG REAL NIGGA SHIT AND CANCEL MY FLIGHT
@southwestair Where are all your employees in St Louis??? You have huge lines and no one here to help us. I better not miss my flight.
@AmericanAir Our flight from Sao Paulo to Dallas was delayed by 7 hours? What happened?! Any better way to get to ORD?
.@united is killing me. Somehow I'm NOT sitting next to my daughter on our flight!?!? I made sure of this a month ago! Uuuggghhhh!
@AmericanAir ripped my suitcase bag open. I found my keys on the baggage claim. Fuck you. American Airlines.
@DeltaAssist lol still on hold after hour and 20 min http://t.co/0n1j5y4W2l
@AmericanAir completely screwed me and I may miss a trip to Switzerland. @united did everything they could but @AirCanada refusing to help.
@AmericanAir what a joke. Every time there's always something. Delays. plane issues. changing gates. etc. #NeverAgain
@JetBlue Not particularly well. Apparently waiting for a maintenance log to be delivered for the last hour.
On flight 789 MSY-SEA will miss connec 2 PUW 2nite how can I rebook on flight to GEG in AM &amp; not PUW at noon? @AlaskaAir #MVPG #gogo
@united i am experiencing very poor customer service from United. I am a card holder with miles plus to use and have had NO CORRECT HELP
@JetBlue amen. @sweetcatoline. I had the exact same thoughts as you. So disappointed! How bout limiting the free snacks instead?
@united UA1240 DEN-PHX MOST CERTAINLY had a 4.5hr delay today. Now discussing this mishap en masse on rental car bus http://t.co/u3eAwQRrXC
@AlaskaAir  Approaching 75k w/ actual 90k of travel. Been loyal since switching to Alaska. Service is sub par now. Not sure anymore. Andre.
sitting in our seats for about 30 mins in &amp; light check happens to go off before take off -- @AlaskaAir this is an inconvenience 😠😒
@united today's flight: boarding delayed
Finally boarded to Springfield.  @united is one airline I can't fly without issue.  #mechanicalfailure #delayed
@SouthwestAir who made the decision to cancel FLL-JAX route.  Stupid decision!  #businesstravelers need that route.  Now onto @JetBlue
@united 7 days and still no response. poor CS! Ticket: KMM24053361V75406L0KM
This is disgusting. @united http://t.co/049zcxyU8b
Note to anyone listening. If you can avoid it save yourself the trouble and DO NOT fly @AmericanAir today continues to prove among the worst
@united still managed to screw people around cancelling both Newark-London Ont return flights on final day for route. United is a JOKE!
And my flight is delayed. Every single one of my many flights have been delayed. canceled. or rerouted. #UnitedAirlines @united #whatishome
I LUV @southwestair but its wifi is consistently poor. Makes business travel very difficult with them.
Missing duffle vanished between Denver and Miami with @AmericanAir.  Someone help it come home... http://t.co/wQN7z9fw8e
An hour and 15 minutes late and no fuel refill yet @AmericanAir #notaglider
I can't with you rn. @SouthwestAir made me pay for wifi on this flight because you said my RR # and password didn't match. Ridiculous!
Even though I fly @FlyFrontier exclusively. I'm totally hopping on the @united drama bandwagon AND WILL NEVER FLY THEM AGAIN GRRR GRRR GRRR!
By the time we get to SFO. will have spent an EXTRA 6 hrs. over $100 on food in airports. @united #fail #travelingwithkids
@united With all the things you *should* apologize for. worse that you did so to 1st class idiot who put her disabled daughter in coach.
@AmericanAir why am I on hold for 23 minutes and counting just to pick a seat for my booked flight?!?! 😭 #flightproblems #airlinenightmare
@AmericanAir to be clear: this isn't only about lost vacay time. Paid more to fly w my party + reasonable layovers. You changed it anyway.
YO! @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv  give @SouthwestAir their plane back.  They're mad &amp; threatening to take away my Companion Pass. #Luv
@JetBlue is flight 821 from Boston ever going to take off? my dad was stuck on a plane last night for 2hrs taxiing only to go back to gate
@united long time loyal customer HIGHLY disappointed by the service received at IAD today. I hate to say Ill be rethinking in the future
lollllll. my flights cancelled here at laguardia and people are being sent to JFK 💩 @AmericanAir
It seems impossible for @AmericanAir to ever run on schedule. Literally every flight I've flown with AA this year has been disrupted. #fail
@united ayyy fuck u!!!
Seriously assholes?! SERIOUSLY?! What the fuck is wrong with you people... @united http://t.co/vZ6loiJAOv
Feeling slightly frustrated @AmericanAir Flight out west and after 2 hour delay. first ten rows have bought ALL food on plane!  REALLY???
@AmericanAir you fucking suck
Was supposed to have left at 7. plane isn't even here yet. ðŸ˜’  #annoyed @SouthwestAir
@united I'm at Changi airport. I can't check in.. Because you aren't open!? That's #bullshit I can't say goodbye to my friend on terminal 2
Just got off the phone with the rudest @AmericanAir "supervisor" ever. Her attitude and unwillingness to help were beyond shocking.
@united Is there a number I can call ? Missing passenger that landed 2 hours ago on Houston Airport.. She is traveling alone..Worried
Just got the worst service from @AmericanAir from the rudest operator. Shit like this is what makes me hesitant to fly #AA
Unbelievable! I'm on an @united plane stuck in Houston with an engine that won't start. I'm trying to make it back home for military leave ðŸ˜”
Sorry display from @AmericanAir 30 min delay bc engine was dripping and i see more bags being driven to the plane half hr past flight time
@Delta you're change/cancellation policy is brutal and @DeltaAssist rep Paul needs training. #mistakeshappen @SouthwestAir 4 life.
How do I hate thee. #UnitedAirlines? Let me count the ways... @united #WorstAirlineEver http://t.co/W7cYSlC4ra
My favorite part of @JetBlue's customer bill of rights is that a six hour delay gets you MORE time with Jet Blue. http://t.co/lvrL1SAhX2
@DeltaAssist message sent. worst flight experience ever. stress and miss a day of work
@AmericanAir AA1349. No wonder I've never flown AA. I MISS MY PUPPY AND IM STILL IN THIS PLANE
@JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs. 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail
@AmericanAir  Trying to track down a lost item and cant reach anyone.  Please tweet me back with # to call connecingt me to a live person
Orbitz is no longer suing! That leaves United. Mr. @united. your evident threat to freedom of speech is unacceptable. http://t.co/d311g24xau
No @AmericanAir: @kalivolcan Are sincere apologies for any rudeness you experienced. We're you able to get the help you needed?â€
The worst thing you can do @AlaskaAir is ignore a customers problems.  You don't know what you'll lose or gain.  #PoorCustomerService
@united KP just DMed you back. Still no bags. No update. We are leaving Reno on Wednesday &amp; worried we will never get our bags. Please help
Didn't get a food option on my international @AmericanAir flight. Sitting in the back= worse treatment
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir is it possible to be on hold for hours? Where are you #golddesk
@JetBlue worst customer experience! Change flights without notify with enough time !
I have been on hold with @AmericanAir to change my first class rez for over an hour!  #Totallyunacceptable
@united I've had to deal with the United team before and had to wait months for a response. An expired coupon and a weak apology. #unhelpful
@JetBlue is generally a good airline. But they suck at crediting miles towards your #TrueBlue account. By far the slowest airline.
So many iphone6 apps suck @united @hootsuite I'm talkin bout you
@AmericanAir You guys are the worst. You delay my sisters flight. then she reaches Dallas later then her next flight and misses it. Couldn't
.@AmericanAir flght canceled. Rebooked on @USAirways without consultation. Gonna be late for the holidays and no access to #aadvantage perks
Disgusting. Just disgusting. @united #unitedfortahera
Too bad @AmericanAir doesn't give out vouchers for slow baggage like @AlaskaAir does
@VirginAmerica cust servc sucks. after 2 years as Gold Member. time to go back to real US airlines @AmericanAir . @UnitedAirlines @Delta
@SouthwestAir Is your reservations line open 24/7? Got an email to call bc my flight was cancelled but been on hold for 30 minutes now :(
And now I might be stuck in Boston for the holiday?!? PISS OFF @SouthwestAir
@united sitting on the runway in SEA on the way to SFO. just told we're not departing for 1 hour. Going to miss my connection to PHX!
@AlaskaAir Thanks. Angel. Any idea what the problem was with bags on #109 SEA-ANC last night? A few came out after ~20 min then *nothing*
@AmericanAir long lines at Columbus airport. Missed flight. Canceling my AA account today.
@AmericanAir on June 30th u told me that u had up to 60 days to reply to my concern. Still waiting for a resolution or any type of contact
@CokoNee @LMichelle10 @SouthwestAir has lost my luggage. Terribly disappointed.  What a aggravating way to start my birthday!
Interestingly the @JetBlue email about changes is missing the new bag fee and less legroom updates #sosad
@tmckernan you've inspired me to take my issues with @AmericanAir to the twitterverse...good luck to you. sir
@VirginAmerica Hey. my points balance disappeared from my Elevate account. Shows 0 points (I had 65k). Something broken?
.@DeltaAssist Today's non-stop cancelled. autobooked 2 leg route Fri PM-Sat AM. Med Desk no help. had to buy new JetBlue ticket for today.
@fark Ridiculously accurate list.  I still vote @united and @comcast as tied for worst company in history.  ;)
@ParryMCM How long is too long to wait for a customer service reply on Twitter? @Gogo @VirginAmerica
@KarlTheFog is delaying my flight home to San Francisco. At least I can relax in the @VirginAmerica Loft thanks to @prioritypasscom
@JustinNFJK @AmericanAir if I worked there I'd probably kick my own ass
Mechanical failures. indifferent staff...delayed takeoff twice in a row. Yuk @JetBlue
@SouthwestAir I am so pissed with yall like seriously I checked in 4 bags and YALL lost my 1 bag with the most expensive items in it 😡
@ChilledChaos @GoldGloveTV @Delta @JetBlue @united @SouthwestAir I've never been on a plane before but that sounds ridiculous
Hey @AlaskaAir you changed my seats today at checkin! If I can't have the seats I select at booking. then don't offer them to me! #NotHappy
What a surprise. another delayed flight @AmericanAir I should have told my girlfriend to avoid flying with this "airline" #lame
@SiebeUS @danawhite @ufc @RondaRousey @Cowboycerrone @PhilGizzi @AmericanAir lol hoooooly shit. That's amazingly horrible
@AmericanAir. you disconnected me after being on hold 20 minutes. After another 20 minutes. I found that you screwed up my reservation.
@DeltaAssist Im trying for my 3rd flight out of KLNK today. 1st one. captain refused to cancel. 2nd out of the blue. Will I make it to KMSP?
@ilovemytushie my @SouthwestAir flight is delayed 2 hours too!
Hey @AlaskaAir . why did you switch gates to a terminal without precheck in Boston? Adds 20+ minutes to my commute. #sad
Disappointed that @united charges for the first checked bag.
Again?! RT @chessninja: Instead of an advisory so we could travel earlier. @AmericanAir waits till last sec to cancel us. ruining vacation.
@SouthwestAir poor communication and lack of preparation on #SWA #962. May be my last-ever SWA flights.
@united How about the CEO go sit out under the wing for an hour in a cage in the rain and weather.  Piss poor customer service response!!!
@AmericanAir They were kicked off the plane &amp; treated extremely disrespectfully over seat assignment confusion involving a child.Flight 515.
Everyone should know @AmericanAir fucking sucks. nobody ever fly with them. Delayed flight for 24 hours and left our luggage #yallsuck
Really. @JetBlue?!  This tall customer is not happy! JetBlue is cutting legroom from its planes http://t.co/MjqjDxPa9d
@DeltaAssist Help! Because of mechanical issues missing connection. On-line not letting me choose new flights or seats.
@AmericanAir = WORST PEOPLE TO FLY WITH EVER!!
Due to ridiculous $200 fee on $207 ticket from @United I will never again fly with them. Hello @AmericanAir Want a loyal customer?
@AmericanAir I didn't get ur tweet because my battery died. Just a bad experience all the way around.  Bad customer service. Rude employees
@DeltaAssist DL lost my bag (&amp; dopp kit) Toss this scruffy lawyer an ecv 4 having to go 2 court like a scruffy putz! http://t.co/7PFSKKoXOW
Aaaand. shame on you @united and @Orbitz. you greedy greedy bastards. http://t.co/g4ZR4fOFku
@DeltaAssist are you kidding me? ANOTHER flight with broken wi fi? Flight 5702 e170... Not the #deltadifference
I'm sad @JetBlue is making those changes to their policies. I'm sure I'll be flying @SouthwestAir more now
@AmericanAir What is the process to file a formal complaint?
Another day of travel. another screw up by @AmericanAir. I keep clicking "standby for upgrade" and yet I'm never added to the list.  Shocker
@JetBlue been on hold for over 45 minutes any estimate on hold times for phone currently?
Just passed 1 hour on hold without a human being anywhere in sight with @AmericanAir SERIOUSLY? this is customer service to you????
@jetdoc1 @GeneMcVay  @AmericanAir  should change name to Air Ungrateful. Arrogant Air. etc.. or suspend the F/A w/o pay. #fail #boycott
. @DeltaAssist It shouldnâ€™t take 3+ hours to reach a customer service rep when trying to change a delayed flight.  Started calling at 8am.
@TheMattEspinosa @AmericanAir yikes that sucks
@united UA1234 was orig sched for 7am today. Cxl on Sat at 7PM! Revised itinery Mon 10:15pm.Then 11:05. back to 10:15. now 11:20. U r awful.
@DeltaAssist No.  Delta was the worst experience I have ever had flying and I will not fly on your airline again.
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKED UP MY FLIGHT INFO YET AGAIN. NO WONDER @Orbitz STOPPED WORKING WITH YOUR AIRLINE
@united - please PLEASE HOLD flight UA1517 IAH - LAX. It's the last one. Please don't leave us stuck in Houston.
@DeltaAssist my delta #1005577422. could not get gogo wifi to work at all. Please cancel my wifi and refund last Sunday and today Heldur
@united what time do the kiosks open? Currently in Minneapolis...hoping to check in soon? @AnnalissaSwan @elizajackson412 12 of us waiting
@JetBlue I hope that flight 1533  on 2-21 from CTG to JFK has running water.  Because flight 1532 JFK-CTG ran out of running water Not cool
Come on. @AmericanAir ... You said only 20 minutes for wait time on hold... http://t.co/Skk47FnEjj
@AmericanAir is seriously the worst! Flight delayed for an hour and the fat man scanning our tickets is so rude! #
@USAirways @AmericanAir your only solution is the 800# I complained about? I've been a loyal customer for 22 yrs; may need switch to @Delta
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for botching up my flight out of #chicago saying that I am supposed to leave dec 30th instead of nov 30th
@AmericanAir flight delayed really hoping I make my connection in DFW #stillsittingatthegate
Yet another horrible experience with @united. They didn't board group 4 before group 5 &amp; now my carry-on will meet me @ baggage claim #fail
@AmericanAir after 1 hr on failed website another 30mins wait. 35 mins on help line. i was told "Sorry that price is no longer aviable" TY
. @united airlines just UNdelayed my flight by an hour. What in the world? Anybody ever have that happen after they announce delay?
@united flight cancelled twice w/no explanation and a very impatient/irate ticket counter manager. Worst UA experience ever. Can you help?
Just found out @JetBlue is getting rid of free checked bags &amp; leg room. IM SO SAD !!!!!!!!! Jetblue was my fav. Hi @SouthwestAir !!
Hey "air traffic control" stop canceling and delaying my flight please. I don't even know who to be mad at! @united ? The "air"?
You still have a lot of work to do at CVG @united. Baggage claim carousel numbers never posting-- travelers have to guess.
UA4699 @united what's the reason for the hour delay?
@JetBlue Hayes you have already ruined what was a decent airline. You lost a loyal customer.
@DeltaAssist What is causing delay from Syr to LGA flight no. 4951?
So @SouthwestAir u have a "boarding position"...even if you just walk up and haven't been waiting. Some ppl don't like that haha
One hour of delay so far ..... #help @SouthwestAir http://t.co/P8PaVP7vhu
@AmericanAir my flight. 1661 was diverted to MKE.  Any idea when we can leave to ORD?
Holy shit! @iamstevent is on my @southwestAir flight to #Vegas. In-flight impromptu concert always welcomed! #fan
Customer service from @AmericanAir marking a record breaking all time low in the history of airlines...imagine how bad that can be
@VirginAmerica. w my grandfather in the ICU. you require a Dr. note on official letterhead faxed just for a voucher?you've lost a customer.
@Alancumming @VirginAmerica not to mention butter if there is a pastry crust on that pot pie. Ugh!
I'm so sad I didn't win the @JetBlue #NYCtoCuracao trip!! Saw 3 people win and my happy dance would have been so much better!
@AmericanAir never ceases to amaze me with their poor service #terrible  #youretheworst #worstairline
@SouthwestAir No the gate agent said you don't cover stroller bags...and it was late at night with two worn out kids.
@karmandabynes @AmericanAir  I never connect in Charlotte w/less than an hour layover.  I've sprinted that terminal change too many times...
@JetBlue looks like it may be a bad idea. Can't afford to buy a seat for it and no guarantee I won't have to check it. But thanks
@AlaskaAir @theRealJflenn you got 25 minutes to book that flight fuck head
@united what the crap my girlfriend and I booked seats next to each other on our flight home. Why did you move me? #notcool
Every time i have a layover in Atlanta my flight is delayed @SouthwestAir #nothappy
Hey @SouthwestAir can someone PLEASE respond to my #rapidrewards issue https://t.co/xQzvPOz5yj
@united That does not mean they are not way to damn high. Making excuses does not make you better. Corps like you do not care about anyone.
The change in flight schedules on @SouthwestAir between Austin and Nashville has really screwed me up. 😞
@JetBlue Why is my flight from RDU to JFK delayed two hours? Perfect weather outside.
@AmericanAir you're scaring me with this talk of 226 seats in the 787. BA has 214 and it's torture in Economy.http://t.co/wIUsBTFpkw
@AmericanAir in the mean time. we all pay for old airplanes. Seems unfair
@AlaskaAir waited for almost 30 min for my gate checked bag. How do I get my $25 voucher?
@DeltaAssist Are all flights this evening from DTW to Chicago cancelled?
I like @united. but it needs to get its act together in #baggage handling in #Boston. Round trip baggage delays is #unacceptable.
@United still lied why our flight was cancelled and wouldn't pay for anything. Cancelled our United cards and won't  fly United (1/2)
@DeltaAssist lost luggage twice in one trip
@united been pushed back from gate now nearly 2 hours without any further mvmt. Now we need more fuel. Not weather related. Poor logistics.
@united why 867 cancelled today? Incoming flight no issue. 2 more flts cxl &amp; now flying from &amp; to different airports. Don't understand.
been on this line for an hour now... missing potential flights...@Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom where's the staff??? this is crazy !! 😡
@AmericanAir what's going on at MIA? Delays all around. missing crew. last minute tire changes. #notGood missing business due to logistics
@SouthwestAir wifii connection flight 156 to oak is criminal. instead of me paying for wiifii.. they should pay me for waiting
Hi @JetBlue. Love your airline/loyal #trueblue cust.~had a very unpleasant encounter w/crew member~ a first after thousands of miles. DM me.
@JetBlue hello. last flight it was a few rows (1st just a few ppl).  it started out good. but never came back after the safety msg.
@AmericanAir 1113 from PIT to DFW cancelled b/c your plane blew black smoke and maintenance needs to order parts? Can't call this weather
@united Been told flight is delayed 2.5 hours. Glad I used the a United app and came to the airport early. Really?! http://t.co/wtrWS367Jn
@AmericanAir why was flight 249 randomly delayed almost 3 hours? Is this to make up for my flight that actually left on time on Tues?
So glad I switched to @VirginAmerica! @united sucks balls.
@markasaurus @united Now I know why I'm having issues ..My flight was $260 to $272 to $312 all within 30 mins. @Delta is getting my $$ now.
The @AmericanAir merger must be going terribly. I've been rebooked on three separate flights and now another delay. @united status match?
@AmericanAir aa32 IFE not working :(
@VirginAmerica having issues checking in for tomorrow's flight. getting "please see guest service agent at the airport" message
Instead of spending time in the United Club that I pay for I'm waiting for a ticket agent to show up at the gate @united #badservice
@AmericanAir stinks! #canceledflight on this #holidayseason ?
Boarded. then @VirginAmerica said we're delayed &gt;1 hr. They won't even serve drinks! Thank God for jerky! #Seattle http://t.co/tWrj8cFGay
@USAirways you all couldn't seem to confirm that @AmericanAir @Expedia 3hours wasted. $500 lost Disconnected calls no answers booked @delta
@jetblue Should get a full refund of cost of changing to an earlier flight. Been at MCO airport with a 3 hour delayed flight. Waste of $
@VirginAmerica I called to make a reservation and was told that you guys no longer take reservations on the phone. The guy was no help.
.@AlaskaAir ATX ground crew needs to talk with flight crew more. Was forced to check small duffel when LOTS of overhead space. Very annoying
@united won't let me leave #FAR without figuring how to take care of my guitar first. this is how you do customer service. #thankyou
yikes @united 30min delay on the plane. we could have gotten lunch! @grumplesiggy
@united Id say you're the worst airline but being an airline or cable provider is a license to be awful. So I guess you're average.
@SouthwestAir are you going to rebook my cancelled flight (with no explanation) or am I left to fend for myself.
@VirginAmerica Or if it did. I missed it. Is that how long it takes. or just worst-case?
Very frustrated that I book my flight with @AmericanAir and they couldn't help when the us airways leg of trip got cancelled.
@AmericanAir after dealing with your crap for a month you screwed me over on a second flight while I'm stuck in a foreign country. Terrible
@AmericanAir we're 3 hours delayed and going to miss our connection to Rome due to mechanical issues on 2 of your planes. #disappointed
@AmericanAir so you cancel our flight as we're walking out the door and I have to wait 2 hours to talk to a person? #onHold #help #seriously
@AmericanAir awaiting some response from you guys ! This is beyond bad service and not to mention telling customers a lot of lies !
2 hour flight delay. then flight averted in Washington DC; I was supposed to be in NYC 4 hours ago @JetBlue. Wanna let my boss know??
@SouthwestAir - Glad I bought the wifi this evening on our flight.. not! couldn't even load a page.. #weneedarefund terrible service..
@united web team op = rude. stubborn &amp; condescending. Refuses to listen to facts &amp; insists to talk over users w/ redundancy &amp; misinformation
@united @theregoesbabs Always someone else's fault. isn't it?
@AmericanAir Disappointed - 48+ hours since I booked awards ticket. not issued.1 call to address. call 2 on hold. no ticket for tomorrow yet
@TheForwardCabin Have you ever flown Premium Economy on @FlyAirNZ? Best air service ever! Worst @united not even pretzels!!!
@theregoesbabs @united  what the f*** is wrong with you United?  You are responsible for ALL your contractors because YOU hire them.  U suck
@CoralReefer420 @united but I also know how the feeling of waiting is because I always get to the airport about 4 hours early but.
@SouthwestAir flight out of Chicago at 10am saying itâ€™s on time (thereâ€™s no way it is). with a 3 hr wait on cust service. Help with status?
@VirginAmerica.... Delayed an hour because you're short 1 crew member!!!  Flight vx1930.  Really we can't take off cause 1 person!?
Woman (@aloria) gets sexually assaulted in @united lounge and denied boarding and then told "sorry for your inconvenience" (@BreakingNews)
@JetBlue must hate me or something. I swear this is like the 8th flight Ive taken where my tv is the only one broken. #how?
Third time flying @AmericanAir since Monday and third time I'm delayed. #goodtimes #travelsucks #flying
@SouthwestAir this is the same problem I was having.
@AmericanAir has the rudest customer service. that I also had to correct the rep. On AAs policy after she rudely asked me to "prove it" 
@SouthwestAir please get our plane into the gate. 30 min late to depart and now you have us waiting 40 min for our gate! Not a lot of LUV!
Shame on @united @Orbitz Airlnes hav entire teams who rsrch how 2make $ frm cstmrs-But u sue bcuz he fnd a loophole?  http://t.co/IjN0MuxxI6
Never again! If I miss my layover in Dallas because of @AmericanAir they better drive me from LAX to SNA
Trapped under sick PJ. All night party to follow. But for now thankful for @JetBlue TV + FlyFi and that I could get my cookie with my feet.
@AmericanAir info on weather delay policy? Stuck in ELH &amp; was given no notification that you cancelled our flight #4278 on May 11th to MIA.
@SouthwestAir won't let me do mobile boarding passes. Carrying paper is inconvenient! It's 2014 people. let's save a tree!
@AmericanAir Your Baggage Customer Service desk sucks just as bad as your flight service. 3 times they've hung up on me #IWantARefund
@DefeatedGoliath @VirginAmerica At a few points I felt like I was dealing with @comcast. No. wait. Comcast reps are at least nice.
Woman in front of me on @SouthwestAir  flight has a dog in her lap. Not a service dog. Plane smells like shit. Dog shit. #heart
@washingtonpost @united got my family in 5 hours late @ 4am all got sick no apologies either direction unforgivable
@JetBlue waiting for flt 824 which was supposed to take off 6:55. Hasn't been a single announcement about the delay or when we might board.
Really @AmericanAir a 3hr delay again with the first flight out!?
.@FlyFrontier you're ridiculous The fact that a carry-on bag costs more than a checked bag is absurd. This is y I usually fly @SouthwestAir
"@JetBlue: @HauteFrugalista You walking onto the plane with no baggage... ðŸ’âœˆâœ¨ http://t.co/VaquAnti0O" and I was last like a #GirlBoss haha
@lybr3 Shame on âž¡ï¸ @Orbitz &amp; @united for bullying! When they're not #RAPING consumers all of a sudden they don't like their own medicine! ðŸ˜·
@united #fail they cancel part of my flight tell me no refund only a credit. now Im trying to apply it &amp; I'm told I cant. @#$%
@united @TSABlogTeam any possibility of getting some extra security lines open at ORD? This is atrocious. http://t.co/2x6veYYxLS
@JetBlue fuck you
@ohshipp IDK @AmericanAir  WHEN THE HECK ARE WE COMING HOME
2 hour flight and @united lost my bag...!
@jayrobinson @VirginAmerica it__s not my problem. Her job is to be nice and friendly.
@united has 3602 ever left iad for cho on time? Why not schedule it for an hour letter since its always an hour late?
@Alex_Bornote @united Imagine if Ramputh was on that plane. He would still be in the terminal screaming at the elderly and kicking babies
@AmericanAir just spent 45 mins on hold 2have your sales person tell me Id only get assigned seats paying $150 or wait till I get to airport
@SouthwestAir Seems like waiting over 35 minutes to speak to someone about #rapid rewards is a bit long. Still waiting...
Getting that feeling that @united is going to not give me Gold due to some unexplained rule. Will wait and see after this latest trip.
Overheard at #LGA. Consensus seems to be that @SouthwestAir and #LGA Terminal B are the worst. Compared to Greyhound station more than once
@united once again showing a complete lack of consideration for its passengers. Delayed flight and notification costs me friends wedding.
@fly2ohare what's the deal w/ planes waiting an hr on Tarmac after landing for gate? AA3620 still no gate! Ppl need to connect @AmericanAir
Very bad experience @americanair. Tried to curb check bag 1 hour before flight time. I ended up booked on a flight 3 hours later. $100 more.
No explanation re delayed boarding @lufthansa 471 ex @TorontoPearson How very @united!
@united I'm never flying united again after the beyond horrible experience I had in May. I'll pay more $ to fly a competitor of yours.
@united first you delay my flight and then you can't find my luggage! Not the way to keep customers!
Delayed!  I think @SouthwestAir thinks I should just stay where it's warm.  #wishfulthinking
@united hate you guys
@JetBlue 2hrs delayed flight due to prblms.Can't you provde anothr plane?Pssngrs w/meetngs &amp; u're risking lives on a damgd plane.Pls help.
@SouthwestAir the service at Nashville this morning has been horrible. We may not get on our flight because we have no seats.
@DeltaAssist #DeltaOne class. One bathroom broken. And the plane is hot as an oven. Ugh. Only 8.5 more hours to go.  Agony. @twbutts
@united how is flight4294 to SAv showing cancelled in one place and on time in another???
@united I will be canceling my United Explorer Club card and never flying on your airline again. http://t.co/pHl39SPLtw
Not pleased AT ALL that @JetBlue closed the TSA pre-check line early today!! Not good.
I hope you see this too. Your flights are never on time. Ever @AmericanAir
@MatthewLush @JetBlue what the fuck jetblue whats ur problem bitches
@united this is shameful. I am a frequent flyer of yours w/ a breastfeeding child who is tracking this story closely. http://t.co/dsig6U70Ww
@GIAVOS @DeltaAssist the sky lounge’s open bar is a brutal temptation during morning layovers
@DeltaAssist Award  tix LAX-JFK 11-22 Flt 476-dog having seizures-not sure can travel- cut-off time to cancel b/f flt &amp; re-deposit miles?
@AmericanAir - I have been on hold for 1:30 hours waiting for an agent on the phone... There has to be a better way to handle phone calls!
Thanks. @VirginAmerica for taking care of us on our honeymoon! Or. you know. sitting us 20 rows apart. Never flying this airline again.
@DeltaAssist accommodate your customers with cancelled flights and don't just say there is nothing you could have provided transportation
@makeupbyKevan @AlaskaAir Its very rare to experience rude employees at Alaska Air.  (496k miles)
@AmericanAir you guys don't have a flight attendant for our flight so we just have to sit here indefinitely? This is not ok. #MIAtoKW #MAD
I'm having a horrible customer service experience on DL flight 2545 @Delta  and we haven't even left the gate yet. ðŸ˜ . @DeltaAssist
_@CNNMoney: Next time you fly @JetBlue. better get ready for bag fees and cramped seats http://t.co/SUeEvSIDr9 http://t.co/nEzWPPl4cH_ :/
@united 3 hours and counting waiting to check in our bags in SJU and now they're telling us we're losing flight UA1652. HORRIBLE SERVICE
This thing with the baggage. @JetBlue... You're breaking my heart... I'm sure you have your reasons but I'm still so disappointed...
@RobertBlas ever since @AmericanAir merged with @USAirways it has been a disaster. I lost $800 on a conference they couldn't get me to. ðŸ™Š
Thoroughly disappointed with @united condescending customer support. In this day and age. ridiculous.
@DeltaAssist when will you know if DL8604 will be cancelled tomorrow?  Connecting through CDG from TXL.
@united Could you reimburse us for our hotel and food after being stuck in Chicago last night?  Or give us credit towards another trip?
@VirginAmerica #vx961 delayed at San Diego Airport looking like 5+ hours. means into hotel after 11pm at best for a 730am presentation
@DeltaAssist arr #1112 den/SLC Delayed til 10:58. Departing 4749 to YYC 11:11 NEED HELP. Pls notify we're late. Last flt of day.

@DeltaAssist. what's happening in DC? Just landed @JFK and heard all flights to BWI. DCA &amp; IAD are cancelled. Need to get home 2 DC 2nite!
Never flying @FlyFrontier ever again. Been delayed for 6hrs and they have not even said why. @JetBlue plz get service to Miami Intl
@VirginAmerica has the absolute worst customer service. They failed on all levels tonight. Thanks for nothing. Customer lost.
Delayed 12 hours in New Zealand. and was not rebooked in my original seat in business class! FUCK YOU @VirginAmerica @Virgin #neveragain
@United you stranded my parents in Chicago for 24hrs. Unacceptable. Wasted a day of PTO. and my 96yrold grandma is alone.
@AmericanAir what a stress! 2.5 hours with bank and on the phone to your call centre to be told you have put on another pending transaction.
watching @chase and @southwestair credit card reps aggressive sales techniques fail at midway. #sofun
@SouthwestAir // what is wrong w/your network day in and day out? Too many delays! On 1 board at Midway 11/38 flights delayed.
@DeltaAssist Flight 4525 delayed - currently in air. connecting flight 1332 - tried to reschedule for tomorrow but getting error message
DEAR @VIRGINAMERICA YOUR AUTUMN VEGGIE WRAP HAS NUTS IN IT. U NEED TO SAY THAT! U HURT MY ASSIST. &amp; COULD KILL SOMEONE! @torifranceshill

My @SouthwestAir flight with #BrianMcKnight on it has been delayed 4x and changed gates. Finally boarding--I guess we are Back At One.
@united you suck
@AmericanAir why does @USAirways have to ruin your reputation? US719 all boarded and you kick everyone off when you knew there was a delay?
@united you suck
@mcbrinton @united That is beyond unacceptable. Isn't age listed when booking. They need to be rearranging at least one person.
Flying @VirginAmerica after a couple of years. So nice to have good domestic service. Might switch loyalties :). http://t.co/nmpnGq5Tnc
@united on flight 73 sfo to hnl dpearing on Sunday. Noticed plane 3058 is delayed over 6hrs today. Will my flight be delayed tomorrow?
Yo @AmericanAir you just cost me a lot of money for a bullshit 1.5 hour Tarmac delay. You're awful.
Travel group booked her as First. preferred. Last name instead of F.M. Last and @United balked and missed flight. tears. bad feelings
@united missed our flight with KLM from OSL to AMS due to delay with United in EWR (UA38). Extra costs €216 ea. What are the refund options?

@DeltaAssist  I m still waiting for someone to contact me
2 delayed flights 2 cancelled flights and now we're off @DeltaAssist Took me all day but God knows best.
Hey @united. My Flight got cancelled after being delayed a lot. I wasn't offered any compensation beyond a later flight. Can you help me?
@AlaskaAir I have great idea. handle maintenance issues before you load the plane with customers. #everytime
Maybe @USAirways couldteach their agents at bag claim to read your tracking app. I knew why bags missing not them. Ujust blame @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist you responded and didn't even bother to read the post. Typical.
@MelissaAFrancis You must have missed this incident from a few years ago ---&gt; http://t.co/5OW9BKZnql   @united @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir you guys should really offer "miles booster" on the mobile app. I never even knew it was an option until I was required to use
USair went into my bank account without MY consent. No response. just the runaround. Taking this to national news @USAirways @AmericanAir
Hey @AmericanAir - can u help me figure out why an agent has had me on hold for 30mins?
@AlaskaAir @RVTandon email has a discount for $175 for sitting at SJC for 9 hours yesterday due to a "mechanical" delay. #disappointed

Hahahahahahahahaha we were supposed to board 25 minutes ago... fuck @united. stressing me out to be on time and then you're late af.
@Delta @JetBlue @VirginAmerica @SouthwestAir can you PLEASE add flights from DC to Cali because if I have to fly United again I'll scream!
A f*king refund? They cost this woman her husband's life and they issue a REFUND? @SouthwestAir should be ashamed. https://t.co/qoA7apZqDm
Know how I can tell I'm supposed to fly @united today?  Mechanical cancellation. that's how. 100% failure rate this year.
Thanks @VirginAmerica for screwing me over
@Turqmelon @VirginAmerica @united UNITTTTED YOU BROKE MY TSYLOE GUITAR
Flying @united is awful. Their new seats are even closer together. My knees are hitting the seat in front of me. #failwhale
#UnitedAirlines #fail 2hrs waiting one plane. being yelled at. with no righting the wrong. @SouthwestAir from now on @united Just Terrible
@SouthwestAir both of my two small bags are smaller than a carryon suitcase  but I want to make sure I don't have issues
Challenging @TrimGoEMAW to an ol' delay off. Beat this. @AmericanAir. @DeltaAssist has thrown down the gauntlet. http://t.co/w6AyKyuSyW
My brother in law has a theory that everyone has one nemesis airline they should never try to fly. Without question. mine is @united.
@SouthwestAir yes. I finally got past the screen that kept trying to get me to buy slippers from http://t.co/GSLWkzYMbp. But frustrating!
NOBODY SHOULD EVER TAKE @united .. their change fee rules are ridiculous. and they have terrible customer service! Fuck u guys.
@united So you guys screw me again! Is it possible to sit in the seat I book &amp; confirm. I'm tall and you shuffle me to the bulkhead window!
no means of filing complaint via phoneâ€”have filed two web form complaints @united and received no response #hownottodocustomerservice
@AmericanAir check-in at #mia is a disaster. Staff unhelpful and lines poorly marked. People very frustrated!
@SouthwestAir I had to take United to Tokyo.  Working on a 1 hr 45 min delay.  When will SW fly abroad?
@DeltaAssist you are so completely wrong with your support of Obama's executive order on immigration. I am so disappointed.
@united an entire day wasted by dropping us at the wrong airport b/c pilot reached max flying hours by getting to the dep. 2 hours late
@AmericanAir lost my bags it's been 2 days with NOTHINg and now they treat me like it is my fault and they have no idea how to help me.
Last time I flew @United I slept overnight in O'Hare. Now. flight delayed twice. missed connection. &amp; landing 1hr later + 1hr away #horrible
@Bry_Wentz @SouthwestAir the first canceled flight was you. but not your fault. #AirTrafficControlFire #BrianHowardIsAnAsshole
@united cancelled my flight and then charged me again for the new flight. i could have bought it cheaper on priceline. #letdownandmad

Flight out of Kansas delayed. forced to sprint to barely make connection.. No power on plane.everyone has to get off  @AmericanAir-the worst
I've never had a worse experience with a flight attendant than I just did on my @AmericanAir flight to CBus. This women was something else.
Attn all dog owners: @AmericanAir and @USAirways drastically changed pet policy; agents are combative and rude at PHL. Fly at your own risk!
@AmericanAir anything you can do for a former ExecPlat who's stuck at ORD with an infant and a 2 year old?
@united you suck never again
who wants to bet me. @united delayed my flight by â€” 57'. to keep it under 60' they are going to turn the plane around in 35â€™ #OverUnder
@adamhousley @DeltaAssist you have the patience of a saint to be on hold that long
.@AmericanAir $200 in extra fees to sit together? #fail I can assure you no one else wants to sit next to my 2 y/o. Booked @united instead
@united you know y'all are really sad suing that kid. He's not doing anything illegal y'all are just greedy for money!
@united sitting in the airport appalled with the customer service at the 'help desk'. Please contact me to resolve my issue ASAP.
@JetBlue My first trip with JetBlue. thinking it would be a great experience. Well...two hour delay. Not a good start.
Again @AmericanAir ? Explain me this. how is my parents fault not making their flight when u change the gate twice?
@UNITED NATIONS HELP US STOP THIS BRUTAL SLAUGHTER#BLOOD ECLIPSE http://t.co/dFreP69efi
@DeltaAssist  Currently I'm waiting on 800-323-2323 though I've also tried 800-221-1212. I'm very frustrated that no rep will take ownership
Mood-lit pre-flight work sesh courtesy of @VirginAmerica @flyLAXairport - missing my #lovefromturkey crew though http://t.co/oTQrjIm39K
@DeltaAssist Hello. can I please file a complaint from my flight that I am currently on? Can I DM you the details?
@SouthwestAir get to airport to find out flight delayed 4+ hours yet app shows ontime #nocustomerservice no#luv http://t.co/4gDuNlSxBI
@DeltaAssist  I've sent two emails to your comment or complaint line that need an answer. does anyone check that account?
@DeltaAssist I've been on hold for 40min just to do a freaking name change on a ticket.  That's ridiculous.
Stuck in Oklahoma City cuz of bad weather. Sick tired &amp; @VirginAmerica won't even give you a beverageâ€¦ http://t.co/a4X6MOVbkw
Holy shit @VirginAmerica website no need to be so cute with this UI. buying tix is stressful enough. Test your site in all browsers please.
Dear @JetBlue  Your flight notification system &amp; subsequent customer service was awful. So much for "you above all." A frustrated passenger.
@AmericanAir I am flying with us airways on thurs to jfk the flight I am getting was delayed today. I am worried as i got connecting flight
@AmericanAir if a mechanic has a tire off the plane. how can it be delayed only 10 minutes? No mechanic. no tools. NO CLUE!! #8hourdelay
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for two hours at the gate waiting for a pilot. And the power ports aren't working
@AmericanAir @caseystegall except when um taken out of service for a broken seat..
@SouthwestAir  Horrible flight on Southwest.  Sent complaint - they said 30 days to get a response.  R u kidding me?  30 days?  #maybedelta
shame on you @AmericanAir for kicking that #specialneeds teen off your flight.. where has the compassion gone 😠
Checked a bag yesterday for the first time in years and they somehow managed to destroy one of the zippers. Thanks @AlaskaAir!
No response yet from @americanair customer relations. although my flight was delayed 5.5 hours so this could take awhile...
thanks @JetBlue for the ability to jam out to @JSchwartzNYC on my flight to Vegas... he's killing it right now... http://t.co/4sw6ofMssR
after waiting 2 hours on runway.  @southwestair has yet to share info and taking us back to the gate @hobby! Dallas is so close!
@AmericanAir @keithwaldbauer Try 7 hours at DFW A23. At least 20 still in line. Abysmal handling of PVG cancellation.
@united surly gate agent ABIA today gate 23. Request info on late plane 'none' later overhear long conv with pilot. Shitty custserv as usual
@americanair customer service was poor today checking in issues online but not resolved by AA agent
@DeltaAssist I am still waiting for reimbursement for lost bag purchases I had to make on an Air France flight.  Please assist
@united #5447 is grounded...  Maintenance problem? Dunno.Mum's the word from the cockpit. Can you update us somehow? http://t.co/bDcgZFJm6x
@breakingtravel @WSJ @JetBlue that's a shame. companies that can't stick to their foundations.
I thought @united couldn't get any worse. They've now found our bag but they don't think it's a priority to put it on a flight! #unitedfail
@AlaskaAir I'm bummed I somehow randomly lost my MVP status for no reason or warning. Why don't you love me anymore? :(
@DeltaAssist Is there a reason I would get bumped from my preferred seat back to a normal seat? Never been downgraded before as platinum.
OMG @AmericanAir  Has me late 4my meetings!We've been sitting on the runway for a hour in LAX we must do better! I need compensation
@VirginAmerica heya! I like lots of what you offer. However. your partner @Gogo's practice of making it very difficult to cancel isn't cool.
@AmericanAir my french teacher Ms. Whitten lost her GoPro camera. Please help her find it.
@DeltaAssist A flight of mine accidentally got cancelled on my end and I want to re-book it.
@DeltaAssist who can help me find out what happened with my delayed baggage. because your customer service doesn't have a clue?
The @united $200 change fee is such BS. To top it all off I had the rudest. most condescending customer service rep. I miss @SouthwestAir.
@namnamnoodle @united   American almost did the same thing to me coming home from nationals. #stressful
@AlaskaAir flight 8 today was diverted to BOS. Can I book my own hotel or do I have to keep waiting here?
@united Stuck in Denver w/ 2 young kids. no options to anywhere near Madison until tomorrow... Hope you can compensate appropriately
Rude people at the airport at 6AM do not have time for you. Also @AmericanAir you suck and your employees do too.
Out of all I've been through with @DeltaAssist I wouldn't expect to see my suitcase damaged.
Premium 1k and treated horribly by @united at Newark - so many unnecessary problems now that cannot be resolved. Seriously? #fixthisASAPplz
@SouthwestAir Any chance MSP to MCO becomes a direct flight again? #disappointed
@AmericanAir I have sent in my complaint and am expecting a response
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@jtrosendahl @AmericanAir Similar response from them yesterday. They are brutal.
Not covered by @AmericanAir after losing it and then returned my new hard shell bag like this. #badcustomerservice http://t.co/cXLTZNtssj
Jamaican me crazy: Angry man strips naked after learning flight to island overbooked: http://t.co/w1SYvaMgy4  @AmericanAir @JetBlue
@JetBlue After that news . I vow never to even consider Jet Blue.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 4hrs20min bc of DFW cancellations My best friend needs her maid of honor in SAN t-4hrs ago. HELP!
@united if there's an issue with this flight I will be cancelling my next flight that has been booked with you guys. I need to get home!
Hey @SouthwestAir . the ticket checker at gate a13 (flight 1584) is an inconsiderate rude individual causing a delay.
About to hit a full. two-hour delay. Just sitting on the tarmac. waiting for our final load weight. or something. #notsnowing @united
@DeltaAssist ok guys I've been patient all night delayed flight. mistakenly rebooked onto another flight. no ground crew at MDW A10 !!! UGH
Airlines are playing dirty with seat assignments of late.  Chose my seats with @AmericanAir on flt tomorrow now unavail &amp; have to pay extra
@AmericanAir  flight from phx to dfw delayed over 3 hours. without a reason
@AmericanAir has given me hell after my 13 hour flight. I am furious!! Worst customer service ever.
That attendant should be fired. @united. Don't excuse her behavior. "Muslim woman denied soda can 'weapon' on flight http://t.co/kIu41uuR78"
@united STILL SITTING HERE WAITING ON A FLIGHT THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO TAKE OFF HOURS AGO. 5th strike. @AlaskaAir can we switch?
@FoxNews @united the people saying rude things about the mother and daughter clearly do not understand autism in the slightest
@AmericanAir I tried calling because weather delays made me miss a connection but the phone service told me agents are busy and disconnected
Please read the story and retweet. Until @united take actions for this horrible behavior. @maysoonzayid @UncleRUSH http://t.co/W8Cb2GZeNH
@AmericanAir you charge for all international baggage now?!? What's the point of getting executive platinum? #nothappy
@Delta @DeltaAssist How do schedule flights &amp; forget to schedule a PILOT?! Delayed. delayed!! Siting on plane waiting to get to Daytona. FL
Either @KAYAK or @AmericanAir or @USAirways screwed the hell up on my sisters flights to Spain. And now they're all pointing at each other
There really is no limit to how comprehensively @united mess things up. You'd be better off traveling on the back of a camel.
How does a bag get lost when you check it in the BACK of the plane? What gives? @AlaskaAir
30 hours of delays. breakdowns. stoppages. and poor customer service has solidified the fact I will never fly with @AmericanAir again.
@Bend_Sinister @united how do they fuck that up?
@DeltaAssist I'm signed up with @TSA Precheck but have not gotten it 3 of my last 4 flights . Why? #sad
bad flight karma/cancellations today with tornado weather in AUS/DFW @AmericanAir
@emptywheel @united You can reimburse me me 543usd ticket you stole. Fuckers.
@DesertProfPhoto @jaketapper @united I have a severely retarded sister &amp; wound NEVER take her on a plane.  Rules are rules.
@AmericanAir go fuck yourselves. You lost my luggage
@JetBlue can't book anything. Site didn't let me pay. Very Frustrating!!!
I'm on a @SouthwestAir flight and the flight attendant isn't rapping the introduction... Disappointed.
Hey @VirginAmerica. I wish your $22 in-flight @Gogo wifi service wasn't so slow... this is def not a case of "you get what you pay for."
@AmericanAir FLT 3327. After delayed departure we sat 20 feet from gate for almost an hour because you had 2 ground crews working 15 gates.
My @SouthwestAir flight is delayed because a passenger is using the bathroom. This is a literal application of "shit or get off the pot."
NEVER fly @United Airlines. Stranded for two days in Houston because of their mistake. Worst experience I've ever had with an airline
@MikeHazeGaming @HugS86 @VirginAmerica That's actually pretty fucked up tbh
@JetBlue u lead me on #notcool http://t.co/uAQvibuGzG
Why can't @united ever be on time. Terrible.
@AmericanAir any news on flight departing from PVD to PHL? I am on flight 4109 us airways an delayed +2 hrs??
Hey @VirginAmerica is flight 404 from LAX to JFK ever taking off? 145 minutes late and counting...
@united worst airline  - never fly United. They have managed to fuck up 3 out of 4 of my reservations in the past 3 months.
@DeltaAssist My flight got cancelled and there's no alternate flights. Can you please cancel my itinerary and refund the cost of my ticket?
Fire at radar facility impacted @SouthwestAir &amp; @Delta but SWA site/app went dark Delta was able to get me home SWA response:"Sorry" #fail
@JetBlue they only informed us that that there was a delay. did not provide explanation for why (hence why I asked)
@realantmoney @united you really &amp; truly suck. though. Consensus is that you are the shittiest airline of all time. But you don't care bb #$
@united what a shit show you have become. Did you really think no one knew why you didn't just cancel? THE WORST RUSE EVER. SHAMEFUL.
@DeltaAssist not impressed with @Delta team in JNB - no recognition for #diamondmedallion it would seem. Stuck in the back! #loyalty
Wow @JetBlue can't believe that happened #Disappointed
@SouthwestAir  What is going on with flight 750? Already I have 2 notices that it is 1 hr delayed but isn't sched to depart until 5:30 p
Not sure I can ever fly @SouthwestAir again. Another delayed flight. Air conditioner is broken and we are overweight. #safetyfirst
We now have landed in #Dallas but no gates are open.Now we are stuck in this damn plane till who knows when! @AmericanAir im pissed at you
@HandicapThis In my experience. flying @united = lost luggage and bad customer service
@AmericanAir lost ticket issue still not resolved after a year. you tweeted me to file the complaint again 20 days ago. still no response
fucking guy at airport checking tickets was a fucking dick #loganairport @united @loganairports #fb
@DeltaAssist  hmmm I requested for status match 2 weeks ago. but nothing from Delta. A bad start. I should just stay with United.
@DeltaAssist Your website still having issues. On hold over 1/2 hr yesterday 2 upgrade &amp; today still can't book what I need. #toosicktocall
@United Delay going on 3.5 hrs for maintenance. Funny how it keeps getting pushed 30 min every 30 min. Time for food vouchers. IAH E2
@united customer service in Houston is horrible. After delayed and missed flights the slow service is a joke.
@Delta @DeltaAssist saw reply re @RobMaguire's lost skis.Any chance you could track ours in SLC? No word from u and no one answers ur phone
Went from best customer service @LewisCollisionCenter to worst @AmericanAir #epicfail in a flash.
.@southwestair has kept @lfurniss and I in LAS from 4-11pm after delaying us 9-12pm Fri for our flight here- get us home to SFO for sleep!
@AmericanAir I DM you waiting for response
My life would be so much easier if @SouthwestAir would fly from Amarillo to Cincinnati. I hate flying American.
@united u wasted 2 hrs of my life keeping me &amp; 100+ people on ur plane b4 take off &amp; failed 2 get 4 items of my crew's kit 2 Tampa. Terrible
Shame on you @united and @Orbitz. Why not tighten your systems vs. going after the one who exposed it #skiplagged http://t.co/VBo1siLd8f
Just sat on hold with @SouthwestAir for 15 minutes... I think not!  Maybe a customer service rep can contact me?
Sitting on @united 6483. Two hour delay. Steward served alcohol to first class. Refused to serve alcohol to the rest. Then steward lied.
@Cudlitz @AmericanAir. . Hope They compensate you for what you lost. . Don't let that shit slide!!
God. after this trip with your #safetravel #blessings I will NEVER. EVER. NEEEEVER fly @southwestair EVER again for as long as I'm Black.
At least @AmericanAir has nice seats...oh wait...they don't. I miss you @VirginAmerica #shouldhaveflownvirgin
@united Board at 7:15. Hostage till 8:40. Offered to leave plane at 8:45 JUST in time to NOT make similar flights. Consistently terrible. UA
@AmericanAir schedule problem means miss only direct connection to vacation spot. spending day 1 in more airports instead of island paradise
@united ridiculous that I had to waste 30 minutes rebooking a flight this morning because your website kept crashing #furious
@AmericanAir I just found your breach! I don't need fuel for my ships! I will fucking close the industry faster than you can drop your pants
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica people that work in the service that are rude should be tar and feathered
4:39p flt 89 from JFK hasn't left and we're still stuck on the plane. and @JetBlue  pilot says our nonstop to SAN is stopping in Phoenix?
@DeltaAssist Consistently screwing your Diamond customers is not the best way to build loyalty.
The story about @united doesn't surprise me at all. Any time I have had issues it has been on that airline's flight attendants.
No! “@iLuvvit: A New Era Has Begun for @JetBlue. and Travelers Will Hate It | http://t.co/ZmnldRsEqd http://t.co/zHWEAY5wh5 &lt;--- WOW. Fail.”
@JetBlue #jetbluejingle silent night. red eye flight all is calm. turn off the light round yon sleepy heads. waiting for flight
Flight out of Cleveland scheduled for 2. Delay. wheels up 3:25 @united #wannagethome http://t.co/EihIBrmAD8
Hey @SouthwestAir I scheduled the worst flight time ever #772 tonight to Vegas. Any chance pilot could get us some score updates? #GoBucks
Hey @DeltaAssist. flight 996 landed 1.5 hrs ago. please explain why I'm still trapped on this plane?
The new @united site looks like a Windows Metro ripoff. https://t.co/OauqleQpeR
@united If I miss my connection &amp; have to spend a night in Chicago 'cause you can't get a gate crew. you can pay for my hotel &amp; sitter. Grr!
@zachgilford713 @AmericanAir i normally stick with @SouthwestAir or @JetBlue. Never an ounce of trouble.
@AmericanAir I need your help and am stuck on hold.
@AmericanAir The day of flights (25+ of them!) I want to visit my sis (on miles) are blacked out. #rude @SouthwestAir does it better.
This is how @united treats safety concerns? Never flying with them again. and neither should you. http://t.co/HT8btV8GzF via @usatoday
@JetBlue JETBLUE SAVED THE DAY AND OUR LIVES!!!! @SpiritAirline you're the worst thing ever! @Winthrop_cheer #jetbluerescuedwhscheer
@AmericanAir I would suggest making this a priority in updating the fleet. as I've had this issue on a number of consecutive flights.
@JZaler Switch over to... @united?? You joining me in the 1st class cabin?
@SouthwestAir and another delay for my returning flight. This time 2 hours. Whoopdy doo.
@DeltaAssist my flight from Melbourne FL to ORD has been delayed tomorrow morning and I will now miss my connection. Please advise.
if it were up to me. theres no way in hell im flying home with @united tomorrow!!! ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜’
@united if you're going to make me gate check the bag I didn't want to check. then please don't make me wait for it to get to the carousel.
I hate @united. No one knows the refund policy been given the wrong information multiple times and can't get a refund b/c my son had surgery
Oooooo! Fancy new @AmericanAir plane with mood lighting for my flight to Boston. Even smells new! #spoiledTraveler #newPlane
@united fuck boy (aka @sammywilk) needs his luggage
@united we are finally boarding. Looks like we will leave around 2 pm vs 10:35 am. I am glad that we r leaving but overall it was a disaster
I will never fly @united again. Each flight is either delayed or cancelled. What a joke.
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
Frustrated at @AmericanAir over refund policy.  They get all my business travel and won't help on a personal travel need.
On the 12th day of Christmas my airline gave to me 1 flight to delay and a 12 hour layover bc of a missed connect! @united
@united #UA1491 was delayed 157 mins. so I had to switch to @SouthwestAir to get to a wedding on time. Not the #UnitedProgress I expected :(
After years of @united switched this week to @AmericanAir and got an upgrade on my first flight. A promising start!
@AmericanAir you need to get your stewardesses in check because one of them were very rude and racist to my grandmother
Stuck in Denver !!! Maybe till Tuesday? Anyone wanna adopt me till then?? Lol #United #UnitedAirlines @united
On the phone with #JetBlue operator is rude &amp; I'm just trying to resolve an issue after a death in my family @JetBlue I usually love JetBlue
@AmericanAir just missed my flight back US1725 was stuck on Tarmac for 1.5 h. What's the biz?
Can anyone explain why @united is delaying my flight in 5 minute increments instead of just saying it's going to be an hour late?
I hate you. @SouthwestAir. I really hate you.
@AmericanAir SUCKS!!!!!!
Never flying @AmericanAir again. next time it's @Delta or @JetBlue
Bad Customer Service... @SouthwestAir non transferable policy is completely unfair. BEWARE.
Touchdown in DC for #ncte14.  BUT we've been waiting for a gate to open for 25 minutes. Ugh! @AmericanAir
@JetBlue Thanks for the advice. but baggage isn't lost. it was sent on a flight we didn't make and aren't going to #PHX anymore.
Has anyone ever got a refund for a cancelled @AmericanAir flight? Six months and I’m still waiting…
Update on the clowns @United Airlines. So late on departure we were fogged out at destination. Diverted to city 400 miles away #3rdWorldAir
@DeltaAssist bags delayed at JFK for 6 days. @RAM_maroc waiting for Delta to forward bags and Delta says not their problem. What do I do?
2 hours waiting for an @united gate at #ord.  @AmericanAir isn't having this issue.  #unacceptable  #switch
@altonbrown @united is awful. Too bad it takes a celebrity to get them to pay attention. It's always something with them. sadly.
@AmericanAir I can tell I am on AA flight and not a US Air flt bc the flight attendants are RUDE w BAD Attitudes. AA flt 148.
Oh how awful! @DeidreDoom @JetBlue @USAirways
@JetBlue has anyone ever told you that your online check in is the worst in the industry.  Hire a new web developer and fix your shit
@AmericanAir I emailed in. and am very upset still.  AA said our bags are still in Dallas today yet!  This is ridiculous!
After a 2 hour delay @united decides to swap out the plane. Basic maintenance omission! Really beginning to dislike this airline!!!
Playing ping pong at #yyz trying to find someone who can solve a big screw up. @AirCanada @united
@Southwestair wifi connection on my flight is terrible. Switched devices to try and fix the problem. now I'm out $16!
Here is to missing my @delta connecting flight. 2hr layover it's not enough time... @DeltaAssist
@SouthwestAir delay a flight 2 hours on a Sunday night. Bunch of dick's.
@AlaskaAir stuck in plane for over an hour due to a light that went off as we were gearing up to take off. Super hot and no water!
I should have left at 5:35.. @AmericanAir  is fucking up
Long commute this AM made longer by my @united delay
Very disappointed in you. @AmericanAir. Nobody every fly them. EVER!!!
Hey @UNITED  Be respectful! Apologize to @taherahahmad ! Treat everyone the same and don’t allow hate to fly with you! #unitedfortahera
@DeltaAssist disappointed on my last 4+ hour trip.  No entertainment options. no coffee and poorly stocked food cart.  #longflightfail
@united gave me a voucher for my overbooked flight seat than took it back when the plane didnt leave bc of engine failure #NeverAgain #Fail
@united the website for reporting damage caused in flight requires a pic of damage/receipt but then refuses to load pics.  Insult-to-injury.
@united Seriously?A fussy two year old is a safety concern warranting kicking his mom off your plane even after he fell asleep?  #PRDisaster
@AmericanAir sitting on the Tarmac again for 23 min. 1826 PHL to PHX. What's the hold up?
Finally boarding plane after 2 prior planes were cancelled. 5 hours delay. First time flying with @AmericanAir and not impressed.
You're Not Going To Be Happy With The Big Change Coming To JetBlue http://t.co/gKU5HnKEBp | Agreed. I'm not happy. #travel @JetBlue
..and just like lindsayrichardson said. days off and a cancelled flight in the @united lounge leads to… http://t.co/IXjBvfyiKW
@AmericanAir it is so sad that your company has to be called out online in order for actions to be taken on the Cantrell families behalf.
@JetBlue. can't PM you. Adam Frederick. I filed complaint through the link you tweeted me.
45 minutes for luggage. Why I never fly @AmericanAir #fail #mco @Delta guarantees prompt arrival. that's #service
.@united no words for 1) not allowing me to check my bag 2) waiting in ewr for 8 hours for a later flight 3) leaving my bag in CLE ðŸ˜¾
Oh wow @JetBlue. you've been my airline since the beginning and now you're just like the rest. what a shame. #heartbroken #betrayed #JetBlue
@united @GrahamDeLaet Funny United. When we were stuck in Houston with NO tix that we paid 4 w/our young nephew u offered us a $10 meal.
sounds like y'all fucking suck @united
@AmericanAir So past miles lost. pay to reinstate. accounts will merge mid-2015. but no need to use AAdvantage now since 0 balance. Correct?
@AmericanAir delayed my #flight. missed my connection. Set me up with a @Super8Hotels in #dallas. #gross
@AmericanAir lies.lies.lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 24 minutes.  I wen't to submit an official complainnt per your twitter bio...and it told me to call?

@DeltaAssist lost the black belt to my trench coat on flt 999 on 10/15. Pls help!
@DeltaAssist 1st you cancel my flight out and make me move my vacation a full day. Now we 6 hours late leaving. You owe me more than snacks.
Sitting @AmericanAir admirals club waiting on my flight.. Already tired of hearing about the Pats
My only complaint about @VirginAmerica: HUGE WiFi fees. $12 per hour (buy 2 get 3rd hour free). @SouthwestAir is $8 per day!
@DeltaAssist - messed up the flight for my honeymoon. even has first class. Wish you guys would help fix the problem. @Delta
Still no luggage &amp; no info from @SouthwestAir on its location. Also. no return phone calls all day. This customer service is terrible!
When I’m flying 1st class. @americanair @delta @USAirways @VirginAmerica will get my biz. @United is ridiculous now only allowing 2 bags
Not happy @JetBlue is going to charge some passengers for their bags. Add them to the list of airlines picking pennies. Glad board is happy$
@united state college flight delayed because you didn't have maintenance crews but you knew the plane was messed up last night
@united #5! Delayed planes in a row! My dysfunctional relationship continues. Waiting for my BF to make more promises he can't keep.
@Delta flight landed 40 min ago. On tarmac. Touring LAX airport. Folks vomiting from the rocking. HELP @DELTAASSIST
what a shame! @emirates doesn't allows to use lounge at #JFK for #FIRST and #BUSINESS class awards tickets issued by @AlaskaAir ! #Emirates
@United so sad you caved to @billburton. You were my 1st choice-May have to rethink that!  Viva la Freedom-Je suis Charlie.
High winds in NYC have already cancelled one of my flights. @DeltaAssist. what's the likelihood of DL7308 departing tonight? #delta #delays
@SouthwestAir over an hour I was told my call would be returned in 17 minutes. Why do I keep having bad experiences with my former fave?
@AlaskaAir this is how your agents make me wait while laughing and chatting with colleagues while I'm desperate to http://t.co/thq9xKvEkQ
@united you really messed up graduation weekend for a canceled flight Now we and one of your employees has to suffer finding us a new flight
Been on hold about 15 minutes already and no one from @AmericanAir is answering the line.
@SouthwestAir just DM'd res. weather is 1 thing. but leaving us w/out bags overnight is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir one person checking passengers in @GeneralMitchell and 25 people in line. Other airlines around you fully staffed. #fail
@AlaskaAir Gogo was terrible on my flight this morning to dc. #alaskaair #refundplease #alaskavisacardholder
On hold w @JetBlue AGAIN  &amp; @Indigo_Girls "Gallileo" song plays w/lyric "must have crashed his little airplane" #oops #notcooljetblue
@JetBlue well I know our bill of rights but my son is hungry just asked for a box of food and was told it $10. Disappointed. Should be free.
Incredibly furious at @JetBlue because I have waited for my suitcase to be delivered for 13 hours and every employee is unhelpful
Shoutout to @AlaskaAir for ruining the weekend!!
Hi @OrbitzCareTeam. you have put my wife on hold for two and a half hours. supposedly with @AmericanAir. This is the fifth time today.
@iamdanmoriarty at least your iPads were working 😉 I waited almost three hours for a 35 minute @AmericanAir flight on Tuesday
What does @Delta and @DeltaAssist do when you are harassed? They put you and your kids on the back of the plane. http://t.co/lFmGWMnCoq
@AmericanAir  booked on AA RNO-LAX.  Have received 4 delay notices so far.   Standard.
@AmericanAir had miltiple issues with a flight yesterday and the email form on the web only allows 1500 characters. Any other way to submit?
What exactly do you do to fix your reputation for bad customer service @united??
What the fuck. Flight is delayed for an hour and half. Ihy @JetBlue
Oh. NOT happy with this announcement. @JetBlue. That free checked bag is one of the reasons you're my go-to airline. http://t.co/ijwb6KOL8E
@DeltaAssist terrible service no one answers phone!!
#UnitedAirlines yall suck. It's 2015. grow up and issue an apology. @united
@SouthwestAir should have taken off 20 minutes ago. No excuse. You guys need I learn to count. 3102 from ATL to SJU.
@united  completely unacceptable customer service @iah  You screw up and it costs me $300?? #dontflyunited
Really wish @united would stick to @Boeing planes; new Airbus planes are incredibly uncomfortable &amp; poorly appointed. #firstworldproblems
grr @DeltaAssist my flight tomorrow already got delayed an hour but my friend flying the same time on @JetBlue didn’t :(
@DrJCThrash @united Worry most when each announcement delays the departure by delta(t)=announcement interval. Then it never converges.
Love u @VirginAmerica. but yer slumping. 3hr delay ORD-SFO due to weather thats not effecting any other airline? Your better than this.
But then again. they are terrible at flying. landing. driving. and parking airplanes. @united
@AmericanAir the worst customer service ever
My loyalty to @SouthwestAir is OVER. I can't take another delayed flight that leaves you minutes to go to a different terminal to connect.
@DeltaAssist I have to pick my nephew tomorrow. He is flying Delta 4631. When I try to set up notifications. it fails as non-delta flight. O
@united they have never gone with out a delay. Prob cause you have cats running your company.
@JuliaDavisNews @united United sucks anyways.
why do I pay $195 a year &amp; spend thousands on my @united card if they're going to treat me horribly when I fly?! SO disappointed.
@VirginAmerica love you guys but no notification of 1.5 hour delay is some BS. Really hard to coordinate around
@united flight was delayed today by attndnt that was "stuck in traffic". I missed my cnnction. Also miss my sons first bball pratice 2night.
I recognize there's still kinks to work out but @AmericanAir @usairways this is ridiculous! You (cont) http://t.co/7bqKUSZoot
Has @JetBlue ever had a flight that wasn't delayed? Hint: that was a rhetorical question.
@DeltaAssist 35-52 minute wait for customer service?customer service is as antiquated as their fleet (plane is broken too) #deltafail
Hey @VirginAmerica -what's up w/ all the delays out of #LAX? I count 4 of 9 flights are delayed. mine included. #traveltips #homeforholidays
@united I transferred us to #DeltaAirlines who have located &amp; are delivering 1 bag. The other arrived LHR this AM via u. Still waiting.
@AmericanAir I'm disabled and have never felt so disrespected by Carly and your staff at LAX. Lost $100 in baggage as a result. #NeverAgain
@DeltaAssist Boarded flight at 7:00am. Got delayed b/c of an issue. Got rerouted. Now stuck at airport til 4:30pm. None of Delta's concern
@united my poor friend is getting sass from your customer service reps about obtaining past receipts. #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir another delayed flight #4748 from LAX; at this rate I'll be late for Christmas Brunch &amp; staff is clearly dysfunctional at gate
i have had the worst traveling experience with @united and @AmericanAir. never ever eeeever again.
@southwestair please help. my flight was cancelled and I can't rebook online or reach support by phone. #stranded http://t.co/92krvZIfBV
@JetBlue. no problem waiting 19+ minutes to speak to a representative. but having them hang up on me right away doesn't work for me.
@AmericanAir put me on a cockroach of a plane so I got to check my bag with about eight seconds notice. Fuck you. dudes
@DeltaAssist Make it possible to transfer sky miles from my family's accounts. BTW. I'm on the phone cancelling my credit card with you.
@AmericanAir Horrible service. Never flying again with yall.
.@united. this Airbus A319 has all new seats. wifi. personal device entertainment. but no power under the seat? #fail http://t.co/UcTvLyJRsh
@DeltaAssist Purchased ticket for wife and son through Diamond desk. They did not make first flight. Was told it was their problem. NO!
Bye Bye free bag and extra leg room. And this is how @JetBlue lost my loyalty! http://t.co/fa1vIT8oa9
@JetBlue Just looking for an inexpensive way *not* to be stuck in the window seat on my red-eye! $100 is huge for an upgrade to EMS.
@SouthwestAir Is it possible to get someone on the phone anymore? This is the 4th day Ive sat on hold for almost an hour.
@DeltaAssist Furious !! Got bump an hour by @Delta and might miss my Rental Pick up appt ‼️ how can we make this a better day !!!!
One time I had to wait SIX hours for another flight because @AmericanAir dicked me around. I like delta better anyway. #americanairdontcare
.@AmericanAir 35 minutes on hold and counting to make a reservation?! Unacceptable.
.@jasonclampet free "domestic" wifi on @JetBlue maybe. NEVER gotten any wifi on my SJO-&gt;FLL flights (San Jose Costa Rica to Ft Lauderdale)
No wifi on my @SouthwestAir flight to Minneapolis. We have regressed as a species.
@united waited 45 min flight 4916 for bags!  No announcements no staff Really? What a way to start new year!
Is @Delta @DeltaAssist having problems with their login system both web and mobile? or is it just me?
@JetBlue hey. flew with u last night BOS - MCO @ 8.20pm.Great flight but u lost my son's case.Spoke 2 desk @ MCO but not much luck.Help! :-)
Sitting on the tarmac at  #DFW airport. Clearly. @AmericanAir doesn't care that I have a connecting flight that boards in 30 minutes!!
Used my @British_Airways EC # on an @AmericanAir flight &amp; my request for missing Avios was rejected. Any suggestions on how to correct?
Don't Shame people in public &amp; then Apologise in Private! @united @TaheraHAhmad deserves a Public Apology.#ServiceDelivery #unitedfortahera
@united I am flying AMS to EWR momentarily and the economy+ area smells like mold. Really?
@SouthwestAir make fat people buy 2 seats because this guy's belly is resting on my arm. fuck you guys

@JetBlue My child and I missed 1506 MCO-BUF. pd $100 for delayed ORL-JFK 2402 plane mechanical difficulties and leaking overhead on JFK-BUF.
Thieves target @AmericanAir and @united airlines and break into customer's accounts. Listen @KRLD @CBSDFW
@AmericanAir continues its streak! Now 13 consecutive flights that have been delayed by 1+ hours! Way to consistently delay my flights! #MVP
@United can you help my children by escorting them after their flt was delayed? They're on 6279 going to 1544.
@united my wife spent spent hours with #perksplus trying to get them to honor their agreement. Bad customer service! http://t.co/BGrCr45ZHa
@DeltaAssist all flights to/from Wausau has been cancelled the past 3 days. We were delayed over 30 hours just getting here
Very disappointed that I have not yet heard back from @AmericanAir about a situation that occurred last month.
unacceptable service @SouthwestAir | almost 2 hours on a parked plane cause your deicer truck malfunctioned? terrible http://t.co/tf9GUekiKj
@VirginAmerica has been letting me down lately my last 4 flights have all been delayed hours throwing off all my plans.

@SouthwestAir I hoped you could take me home this weekend but no answers at BWI has driven me to Amtrak. Disappointed.
Incredibly frustrated w @AmericanAir website. Hit confirm for flight &amp; didnt get confirmation. 30mins on phone with CS &amp; had to start over
@AmericanAir I have received 8 notifications for flight 1566 from MIA to DFW delaying flight in increments from 505 to 7pm.6weeks in a row.

4 hour delay. This is why I don't fly @Delta. I'm sticking to @SouthwestAir from now on #sorryboutit
Disappointed at the lack of #BreastCancerAwareness uniforms worn by @AmericanAir employees today. And I'm at DFW!
One of the reasons I fly @AmericanAir is the lounges. Just got told at O'hare that now is only intl! I guess you lost another to @JetBlue
I hate @AmericanAir 😡😡😡😡 http://t.co/TuRxPKtPVz
I never want to fly @SouthwestAir again.1st flight was late.missed my flight to vegas.was flown to Dallas.now my 2nd flight is delayed.#Done
@DeltaAssist Having trouble with reservation and get hung up on because I'm not fast enough to enter password. Now waiting on hold AGAIN!
.@Delta @DeltaAssist then proceeded to still be paging for boarding and yet they had closed the gate. #FAIL
@united After an 8 hr.flight back from London with no adudio /video I wait 30 days for you decide if I am entitled to compensation #NotCool
â€œ@JustinNFJK: Guys I would totally fight @AmericanAir but it would hurt to punch a plane. ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¼ðŸ˜–â€FUNNIEST SHIT
An hour before my flight and @SouthwestAir decides to cancel it. I understand why but I wish they would have given more advance notice...
@Delta  @DeltaAssist  Why would the pilot announce  to a plane full of ppl that they are experiencing engine  problems. #needbetterservice
@united you are losing a fan here. Your cust service and lies are becoming very bad. I'm thinking of suggesting to my people to boycott you
#Friday really #sucked .. @MKEairport cause me to lose $1.400 in wages Fri-Mon. Not to mention the $490 ticket from @SouthwestAir #bogus
3 "out of service" planes in a row? what is THAT all about??? @AmericanAir
@united You guys are motherfucking scum. Worst airlines on earth. Hope your business gets bankrupt. Get cancer. the whole lot of you.
California drought must be really bad. Booze at @flyLAXairport @AlaskaAir lounge is FREE but water is $2. #yikes #CaliforniaDrought
@nzlat @DeltaAssist that's shitty! Whenever you come back to Ghana and want high-class ticket service. check out http://t.co/mbd5X6wqH6 !
@AmericanAir you made @TheMattEspinosa  pay an extra 100$ and broke his bag
Cmon @VirginAmerica I'm trying to book flights from DAL to LGA and your site is crashing! I can't miss these savings.
@SouthwestAir Delayed in Baltimore for at least 3.5 hours. $100 travel voucher does not fix my ruined evening. #notenough
.@JetBlue my bad luck with Jet Blue continues. Today they put too much fuel on their 5:45 AM flight to JFK and need to off load #LateFlight
Hey @AmericanAir  maybe you should put more than 3 agents at the counter when you cancel my flight. Nothing like telling me 20 minutes prior
.@AmericanAir youre a despicable. disgusting airline. Your crap doesn't get past me. You are bullies. And liars. I hope you go bankrupt.
@SouthwestAir it was horrible.
@united has once again proven that they do not believe in customer service. #badbusiness
@AlaskaAir nxhddee funny how i pass people in exit row as I board. Guess #mvpgold has lost its luster. #wack
I will never ever fly @united again. how do you cancel a flight hours before because you don't have enough crew &amp; expect everything to be ok
. @SouthwestAir You damaged my luggage and now your #STL representatives are saying they're not responsible for it.
My BRAND NEW web series 'The #SocialMediaSUCKS If Show' - Ep. # 1 is all about @SouthwestAir kicking fools off planes http://t.co/TCaGcZ0vK7
$7 meal voucher!? This isn't going to cover any meal at an airport or makeup for the inconvenience @united has caused http://t.co/L27N3zReeG
@united really haves not felt this bad in a long time.   Please treat customers with dignity not like it is our honor to spend money
Yay imagine that another delayed flight from @SouthwestAir . Can i at least get some pretzels on this flight since our first flight had none
@JetBlue loved my plane. loved the snack selection but hated our 2 hour delay leaving.  #late #jetlagged #ridiculousness
@morgypotpie @SouthwestAir @mayabatshir It's okay. @SpiritAirlines screwed me with a 13hr layover In Ft. Lauderdale (aka Ft. Fucktville)
@billy935176 @AmericanAir holy shit
Never have like @AmericanAir  there is a reason we fly @SouthwestAir 99% of the time.

@VirginAmerica Can’t keep up with demand and it comes at my expense!? #fail
@AmericanAir delayed flight 10 hrs as result we missed our press day tattoo appointments and the chance to connect with people we rarely see
Worst airline ever @AmericanAir - I hate you with a passion. Only flying @SouthwestAir from now on. #StuckOnTheRunwayForAnHour #MissedFlight
@AmericanAir Broken planes/cancelled flights are the worst. Please tell me you'll find a way for me to get back to San Francisco today...

Terrible #customerservice .  Cancelled flt for tom without notice. customer service team is as bad. whole day wasted.. ughh @United so bad..

@JetBlue What's going on with flight 415? Already delayed twice but the weather is fine here in NY. Help a true blue member out!

@united yes. I will file another form for the purchase (bag finally arrived late tonight)
@danimalnelson so sad that @SouthwestAir has chosen to be one of America's worst retailer..
@DeltaAssist hi. I lost my sunglasses on a flight yesterday. They told me I would be contacted and I haven't heard anything...
Real downside of Knicks struggles? With no playoffs and trips skipped I lost my @United gold status. One last insult for last 41 games.
@DeltaAssist horrible experience at ATL int terminal. No sky priority line!
@AmericanAir I don't know. It was flight 1513. Also annoying that stewardesses are so picky about waiting for the bathroom u don't  know
@DillionHarper @SouthwestAir lost bag?
@SouthwestAir my friend lost her bag and is stranded without clothes and her Rx meds. Help!
@AmericanAir my bag missing for 18 days now. if u think they give a shit about u or ur bag. u are wrong. Do not fly with AA they steal ur $
@AmericanAir WTG.  Only took 35 minutes for luggage to start coming out.  Here's hoping it arrived at all. #fail.
@SouthwestAir sucks. 30 minutes past our take off time and were still sitting on this damn plane..
Come rain. snow or shine I always have to wait at least 45 mins for my luggage at the #JFK @AmericanAir terminal... Please improve!
@xRpMx13 @AmericanAir had a similar problem 6 months ago. They suck
@AmericanAir horrible services flight AA3640. delayed 2 hours due to lack of flight attendant. nobody has any information to give
@DeltaAssist we are stuck in Haiti.  Your staff thought JFK was a city so do you really think I want to file a report with them???
what the hell @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir fails us again.
@AmericanAir @JacobWhitesides Jacob stop being rude â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
@JetBlue I've flown 6 segments with you in the past 3 weeks. Of those 6 segments. FOUR of them had inop entertainment systems. Not happy.
Hey @united wonder how come on @AmericanAir @USAirways @SouthwestAir @Delta I can always get PreTSA but never on your airline? You different
@DeltaAssist DL 5028. Delay. little info. Keeps changing. Not your best. Why ok?
Annoyed @VirginAmerica - no checked bags and elevate number wouldn't add in self check in. Had to stand line for no real reason. Do better.
I offically HATE @AmericanAir   Continuous delays =the loss of a customer #sopissed #effamericanairlines 😡
@AmericanAir flight from DFW to IND. What's the haps? Delayed 2+ hours w no weather issues?
@SouthwestAir Worst travel experience. Lost luggage. canceled flights. family separated to 5 separate cities to get from Denver to Atlanta
Waiting for my first Christmas present to arrive via @JetBlue but the flight is delayed 2 hours 😟
@DeltaAssist Your website has been horrible today
@USAirways @AmericanAir cancelled TWO flights that cost me $340 &amp; 50.000 miles and offered me a 7.500 credit. Disgusting. Just disgusting.
@united Help! Booked award flight home from Prague. now @ airport and told flight cancelled. (via @lufthansa.) What now &amp; why no warning?
Disappointed in @VirginAmerica. who. because of delays. had us midair during New Years Eve &amp; didn't even offer a drink at 12. or free WiFi.
@AmericanAir 3 days refusing to release my bag &amp; now its lost in another country. im out 1000s on missed gigs &amp; spent 1k on hotels &amp; ground
@AmericanAir the new merged FF program is terrible. @USAirways nearly every flight was upgraded. Now nearly never. Reconsidering loyalty.
â€œ@DreamCha5er_: The homegirl Wendy @AlaskaAir your employee's are the shit. haha http://t.co/O8XZAFu8U3â€ Lmfao you passed her the bluntðŸ˜©
@AlaskaAir flying tonight. They have cookies but no milk. Sad pandas all around.
Been on hold with @JetBlue for an hour...get us to Turks before the blizzard!
@united UA1490 30 min late b/c as pilot said "someone was too lazy" to prep the plane - sat in hangar all day  #unacceptable
Why @JetBlue and other LCCs will win in the end. Exit row upgrade w/o fee after a 3hr delay. #JetBlue #YouAboveAll
@AmericanAir @aairwaves  - #delayed pdx flt 1078 to arrive DFW12:02p.  Please hold AA #1670 DFWMBJ Honeymoon Bauer
@CMPunk @AmericanAir that's awful. I heard there bad service
@united what's going on? First flight delayed 77min and 2nd flight was just cancelled...
Hey @united please ensure plane has in seat power if your offering personal entertainment. Nothing worse than device dying during movie
@CJanes94 @united I fly Delta. Fuck that.
Dear Airlines. I HATE YOU ALL! Except you. @JetBlue. You're alright. -&gt; http://t.co/dNduTmATK8 http://t.co/fTQJ7n0iuH
Nothing worse than arriving early and having to wait for your gate to open up @AmericanAir #ugh
Hey @SouthwestAir should probably change flight status to delayed if its 835 and plane for 830 flight in not here yet #chicago #notontime
@united We were. On top of a three hour delay. it was adding insult to injury
Next time I will pay the extra money to fly @Delta  been waiting for an hour to board @AmericanAir never again!! #delayedflight #pissed
@TrevorMoran @united Is someone mad about there flight 😝 jk. i would be pissed to!
@americanair the delay on the way out of DCA was made up for in the air. but no way u can make up for this differential back to DCA from DTW
@sorryimalex @AmericanAir I've never been on a plane
@AmericanAir The worst experience of my life.on 01/06/15 I traveled with AA.all was OK until I arrived to baggage area and NO baggage.
.@TaheraHAhmad I'm glad @united seems to be aghast. but you should never have been treated so horrifically in the first place. I'm so sorry.
@united my day?my whole"holiday"is ruined cuz all the appointments I had were cancelled because of my delay.and that was WHY I came here for
Hey @AmericanAir. I know I'm just an average Joe &amp; 1 of several customers. but I will never fly with you again.
remember this @united ? Now the worst airline of the planet “@oldschoolads: 1976 - United Airlines. http://t.co/vG19WfWtB1”.
@JetBlue why the delay of flight B6224 from LA to NYC?#Rain in #NYC gone as of very early morning this am?No reason for #weatherdelay today?
I'm pissed AF bro @AmericanAir is the worst I swear I'm about to miss my damn flight this is some BS
I feel sorry for those on @SouthwestAir flight #2768 having their flight delayed 3 hours.
@TripAdvisor does it make sense to buy a tix from UA site and get poor service from a partner airline. Without @united offering an apology?
@AlaskaAir I'm still in line which hasn't moved. There is one person working the counter. I have never seen anyone who works this slow
@AmericanAir late out of YYZ. barely made connection to SFO at LAX. &amp; now waiting on tarmac 15min bc a plane is at our gate. Come on.
@zahraschreiber @DeltaAssist Someone must suck at their job
@AmericanAir AA I am frustrated with you all this week. Have had a poor retail experience with you all .   Help me help YOU help me !
@AmericanAir flt#2356- coming up on one hour since we boarded but plane still not left the gate #fail
@AlaskaAir thanks for stalling my flight on the Tarmac but not let us stream the game!!! WEAK AS FUCK!!!
@AmericanAir I was trying to locate family members who had flight issues &amp; needed to confirm that they were checked in on another flight.
I hate flights delays but here is how @SouthwestAir is keeping us entertained...
@DeltaAssist could you please give me an update on my missing miles from the trip back on May 26th?
@united I got screwed please help me out
FUCK YOU @USAirways @AmericanAir. Like for real.. FUCK YOU
@DeltaAssist I am so made I didn't fly you to Boise--if I did. I would be at home to night in DC before the storm. US airways is the worst
@DeltaAssist and delayed again. Why? Why?  Why me? &lt;joking hysterical drama&gt; ;-)
@united another mechanical/electrical #failure. This is 1hr delay #insanity #Award #Miles r #decent #compensation 2 offer. 1hr. #Seriously ?
@VirginAmerica flying out of BOS tomorrow and the website says i can change it to tues for no fee bc of weather. but its not working online
@JetBlue way to sell out to the greedy stockholders and leave ur loyal customers behind. Now u are like every other. #neverflyjetblueagain
@united I'm wondering how long you can delay a flight and keep the passengers on the plane? Flight 1136 from LGA to ORD. #Trapped
On my last trip on @VirginAmerica my bubble helmet was destroyed. I really hope they will make good on their error. https://t.co/moKn2aXL81
@TeresaWeakley4 @united @Dulles_Airport they have become one of the worse airline out there
@united ASHAMED
@united As UA1637 was delayed by over 1.5 hrs. I couldn't take public transport home and had to take a cab. $2.75 vs $60. Any compensation?
@united Ur customer service confirmed bringing a snowboard was only $25. checking it at the airpt today was $150 #unitedairlines #complaint
Took @united 2+hr to get my 85 yo mom frm plane to @NY_NJairports terminal last nite b/c of broken elevator. Obviously NOT elderly-friendly.
@libraryyeti The way @united treats breastfeeding moms is reason enough to land it on that list. Their behavior is highly illegal.
@PatfaceCatface @united the red roof inn near the airport is mad siiiiiic. Where I stayed when they stranded me #thanksunited
@AmericanAir NO flyer should experience 3 HOURS DELAY! NO WAY! Connect with @Gabie1 via phone and accommodate her PROPERLY! #customercare
@united . our plane was delayed 4 hours and on top of that. you ask people to give up their seats at the last minute.....#SMH #neveragain
@JoshMcDermitt @VirginAmerica That means you should come to NYC!  All joking aside. that sucks. Hope they help you out!
@united I've had two flights today. and they have both been awful
@AmericanAir @Travel_Codex : I've been on hold for 2hrs to find out more about cancelled flight 190.
Hey @united get your act together. Supposed to fly SFO-DEN-SDF today but SDF-DEN IS delayed and now we can't get home until tomorrow.
@VirginAmerica there is one complaint I have. @AmericanAir has a better inflight screen. #WhenDidThisHappen http://t.co/WgaBiFOflm
@Convertbond @united you act like United cares about it's customers. They never have and never will.
@SouthwestAir is AWFUL! I don't know why I gave them another chance. Waited in line 1hr to check a bag that didn't arrive at my destination!
It's 3am MT and @DeltaAssist has a 31min wait.  Who the hell are they talking to? #wtf #annoying #CustomerService #fail
@xosdlc still? FUCK YOU @AmericanAir
@united Do you recruit your flight attendants from the gates of hell? Mind numbing at how rude you are treated. 1K. Million Miler here. Ugh.
@united worst flight experience. Several Self check in machines down w/ no help for 20 minutes.  We almost missed out "delayed"  flight.
If I heard right on #PeterPanLive - think happy thoughts. â€œ@urbanviewfinder: I'm on a broken plane @JetBlue ... Will i Ever make it to CHI?â€
@AmericanAir bag still not here #ridiculous
@SouthwestAir has the worst wifi ever :( but hey. at least I have wifi.
@DeltaAssist my last flight sucked. I have two more flights to get home tomorrow and I hope they aren't as bad or loud as yesterday's was.
@DonCapri @DeltaAssist You have not been liking #Delta lately. ðŸ˜• As a Gold Skymiles member that makes me sad since that is my fav airline.
@AmericanAir hey American go fuck goats
OK SERIOUSLY FUCK YOU @united SO FUCKING UNHELPFUL FUCK YOUR AIRLINES #UnitedHatesAmericans
@JetBlue when will flights AFTER 10/24 be available!!! So frustrating!!!
Thank you @AlaskaAir for putting me with screaming children for the entire 5 hour flight and not having me sit with the person I'm with
@JetBlue love when I get ripped off by your FA. I upgrade to even more space and somehow it cost me $5 more then usual. Lost customer!
@DeltaAssist just tried to call delta to cancel my flight and wait time is 4 hours. help!!
NEVER FLYING UNITED AGAIN! CANNOT GET HELP FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE OR INTERNET. @united http://t.co/Mc6DjmBQYW
@salesforceQueen @united I've never had a smooth experience with United.
@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane. now the lines are frozen.
@AmericanAir first class upgrade that I would PAY for and they would not let me upgrade because I'm not platinum @VirginAmerica I miss u
@SouthwestAir My flight just got cancelled help me out! What do I do ðŸ‘€
i'm already sober I'm suing @JetBlue for emotional damages
@DeltaAssist I am totally short of words on how to describe the service I have received from Delta. Delta delayed our flight from Houston
@AmericanAir worst customer service ever!
@AmericanAir awards member &amp; stockholder. On hold for 10+ hrs re: flight 1568. In meantime. spent $1200 on contingency plans. Bad service.
@SouthwestAir really dropping the ball today... Idk if I will ever get on the runway. Third flight and counting with a delay every time
@Little__Time @DeltaAssist That's awful. I'm not flying Delta in the future.
Just had the WORST. worst jetblue flight EVER!! They definitely lost two loyal  customers! @JetBlue #reallydiaappointed
@united rebooked my flight to avoid the pre-Thanksgiving storm without charging a flight change fee. Who says they're the worst airline?
@AaronCarpenter @united then why does everyone ride it if they hate it so much
@united never ceases to disappoint me.. . #howdoyouloseanentireplanesluggage #1amandstillatORD
Will never fly @united again http://t.co/jZqnfj5wQy
"@KingBach: This flight attendant on @united airlines is extremely rude. Shoulda flown @Delta ✈️"
@ArianFoster @united this is why i avoid united.  always something and the internet never works on the plane.
...note to @united: Never piss off a journalist by making her wait.  Now @karaswisher has nothing but time to write about her experiences!
@JADubin5 @united This sounds like hell. I've had horrible travel experiences. but this takes the cake
Welcome to the Hotel California!  You can come to stay but never leave!  @JetBlue @emac1313
@AmericanAir you changed #925 on a 777 from MIA to LAX. Now it's a 737 to LAX? A response of "they change and don't tell us why" is poor.
Thankful for @southwest who can get us to our destination after @jetblue cancelled a full flight with 0 alternatives.
@SouthwestAir Hey when will I be able to book flights in November? Been waiting a couple months to book my honeymoon.
@FlyAirNZ Learnt a VERY EXPENSIVE lesson Don't fly coshare @united flights with extra bags Total ripoff &amp; @FlyAirNZ helpline not very 1/2
Been a while since I flew @JetBlue and still NO WIFI. on a Transcon flt to boot.
@JetBlue classy - delay by 3 hours with no plane replacement then divert to slc with no apology - never flying JetBlue to sfo again
I'm praying @AmericanAir will not cancel their flight out of syracuse tomorrow otherwise all hell will break loose
@AmericanAir after a delayed flight. bad customer service. delayed suitcases and not even an apology. I'd be crazy to fly American again!
@United please allow Kerry Smith to inspect her dog's wellbeing immediately upon landing. On tarmac for 2+ hrs. this is critical.
@united giftcardexchange still down more than 1 week. No response from vendor. United should drop this vendor. Ruining ur earned reputAtion
0249 0195 4321 All three flights that I took this week from @AmericanAir  delayed/canceled. Pathetic service even worse customer service!
The plane started boarding at 630. I'm still sitting on the runway 5 hours later.  This is brutal @united #Linus
@AmericanAir 1810. it was a maintenance issue not weather.
@SouthwestAir 30 minutes on hold on the phone? What's the deal?
Hope @SouthwestAir will fix my prob w/ the No Show Policy Never heard of it &amp; never warned. I fly often &amp; will gladly take my biz elsewhere
Never fly @AmericanAir. Why? We were taxiing and they realized the radio was broken. Then waited 1hr to decide what to do.
Gah.  @JetBlue pushed my Tuesday flight by 12 hours! Not cool.  guys.
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to cancel a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@DeltaAssist Still no response... #Delta
@JetBlue having  problems with my travel package.Just spoke with hotel http://t.co/kLupBce9ZA and was directed to you. Can someone write me?
. @united  leaving me out hundreds of $$ in hotel and an entire tank of gas making FIVE trips to the airport. to get NOWHERE. Worst ever.
See you Tomorrow morning @AmericanAir - The long wait &amp; break from the air has ended. Yay :)
i had a horrible flight yesterday and i paid too much money for it .... i need my money back @DeltaAssist  @Delta
I WILL NEVER FLY @SouthwestAir AGAIN. EVER.
Wondering if I can just buy a one-way ticket on @SouthwestAir so I don't have to wait 3hrs in the airport. #delayedflight
@AmericanAir Your baggage claim service at @PHLAirport tonight is terrible. Been sitting here with 3 young kids for over 30 min waiting...
@united So if I have a problem with the refund I can't communicate w anyone?
@deray @SouthwestAir you poor mistreated thing. You actually have to pay for something instead if screwing someone out of it.
@DeltaAssist flight 1053 to atl late last flight to Sdf 2491 what's my options
Never had such a hard time flying and having the worst customer service experience. Smh @AmericanAir
@Jetblue ate some bad Chinese. and my puke bag is running out of real estate.  Please advise. http://t.co/wuhdKFUUKr
@_hgordon @AmericanAir you really don't care about your customers whatsoever. We are all suffering from your unprofessionalism.
@AmericanAir True. Like the convenience of having pass/fl status on phone. Recently flew @united no problems with app/ boarding pass.
@VirginAmerica Received error message to call Virgin but wait time is over 50 mins and promo will end by then. Any advise? Rather frustrated
Booked with @British_Airways end up on a @AmericanAir flight. it gets cancelled now 24hrs later on a replacement flight. it's delayed again
@DeltaAssist my flights have been delayed 3 times. caused me to miss my connecting flight and have been stuck for over 9 hours. I am hungry
@united need to request refund for itin cancelled under the 24 hour flexible booking policy. Can't seem to do this online. RES P2FK4X
@AmericanAir DM done.  Rebooking 7am cancelled flight. #notflyingantimesoon
@AmericanAir Flight cancelled. can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play. @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC.
@SouthwestAir I'm not an A list member and buy Business Select for this.. #disgusting #aviation #flysouthwest http://t.co/kCuvtAPvHa
@united Airlines . don't ever think. even for a second. that You are not THE WORST airline in the world....
Honestly the rudest customer service from @SouthwestAir. Beyond pissed off.
So we just got bumped off our flight to #disneyland. That was a first. And it sucks ass. Thanks @alaskaair for the awesome Valentine's Day!
Smh RT @omarsuleiman504: I refuse to fly @united until they learn how to not discriminate. Pathetic behavior. http://t.co/drYpHVQcKC
@AmericanAir why cancel TUL/SNA 6pm. Trying to get home after 10 day family funeral. Dallas shows open by 10am
I refuse to fly @united #unitedfortahera and those passengers should be ashamed.  Muslim denied soda can on flight http://t.co/2Xo3fKkl1o
Parents have just texted from the airport. @United flight UA080 cancelled. Any reason why. they've not been told anything? #birthday
OMG @AlaskaAir your intl clearance has taken over an hour and we're all suffering as a result. Missing valuable family time. So lame.
@JetBlue Wow. You went from 'everyone's favorite airline' to 'just some other crappy airline' pretty quickly. huh?
@JetBlue PLEASE Tell me 658JB is NOT actually flying flight 477 to JAX! Why cant I never get anything but blueberries?!?
@AmericanAir worst customer service trying to talk to agent and call just hangs up due to high volume.  How can you speak to someone.
@AmericanAir I know this is a shock but my return flt is already 22 mins delayed .#AmericanAirlines #WorstAirline.  Trapped in Miami
Flight cancelled night. my partner is home sick by himself and I'm going to miss my interview tomorrow. @SouthwestAir #sad #disappointed
Sounds like @JetBlue is about to ruin my friends' babymoon vacation this morning. If that's the case. I'll never fly with them again.
@AmericanAir what's the deal with flight 1555? 4 hour delay. 4 gate changes... who's running the show? I just want to go home.
@DeltaAssist why no response?
@united what's up with the sun-slc flight getting rerouted. We now have to bus to Boise to fly out of there? Why?! Highly inconvenient :(
Of course when I want to use my miles. @AmericanAir is only making flights with a layover available to BOS! #fail :(
Traveling with @united is becoming unbearable. Even as premier 1k my bags get lost more than they arrive on time #unitedairlines
@united. Delaying an entire flight because one first class seat will not recline is unacceptable. #UA1663
been on hold with @SouthwestAir for a whole 30 minutes.
At @JetBlue terminal in LB airport. Flight to #NYC is delayed 3 hours. At least there's wifi 👍 http://t.co/9F05tGdfw6
AA56 was the worst flight. start to finish. that I have ever been on in my lifetime. @AmericanAir
Idiot employee does something stupid and company has to apologize. Wait. what? @united standing by the pilot?!?!? https://t.co/M1wB1zxrQK
So. Frustrated.  Don't fly with @AmericanAir.
Is there a way to tip flight attendants because the one on delayed @SouthwestAir flight #515 is A+++++++++
@DeltaAssist @Delta Are any other flights departing Atlanta arriving at Little Rock today?  You cancelled my flight
WTH?! RT @peter_hook1: @AmericanAir appear to have lost all of our guitars...
5 delays and 7 hours later I'm finally boarding.  Can't say this is how I wanted to spend my Sunday and miss my meeting @Delta @DeltaAssist
Why is @SouthwestAir delaying my flight home!!' ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
@DeltaAssist just boarded DL858. The gate staff was horrible. Didn't even acknowledge me. Had to scan my own pass. No eye contact
@SouthwestAir is brutal man.
@DeltaAssist stuck in ATL....service has been horrible.
Last week @SouthwestAir cx my flight &amp; made me wait 2 hours to get my bags back. Now my sis has been on hold for 3+ hours for her cx flightðŸ˜
Really @AmericanAir ??? 3.5 hours on hold and you still won't take my call? #disappointed #badcustomerservice #Snowmageddon2015
After telling us the flight was delayed @AmericanAir gave away our seats and took off as we sat in the airport. 1.5 hours to talk to anyone
@DeltaAssist HIGHLY disappointed w Delta. Requested spec svcs for 84 yo blind father w/hearing issues. Largely abandoned @ MSP.
Does @AmericanAir have the worst service? Fave for 'yes'. RT for 'hell yes'
@AmericanAir so thirsty. Stuck in deserted airport. #sos
Day 3 - no response on fixing things for me after my terrible travel experience from @AmericanAir and @USAirways. At least I have my bag
@RyanAdams41 @united lost mine and blythe's luggage too. My family had 3 people fly to Harrisburg and they lost all of our bags.
Killing me. @united... Third airport today and the original 4 hour layover just keeps getting longer and longer... http://t.co/Hn8lQQejXO
Hey @united poor show that you don't have enough aircrew to run UA3783 on time w/o a 1h30 delay.
@AmericanAir will lose your bags for you and fail to do anything to make up for it. @united do you fly DFW-ATL ?
@AmericanAir That # is for @united and they're not answering. :( Filled out a form online. I fear "black hole" status.
@united I just lost a connection plane.. It was a lie in my case. you said in San Fran that I'd have an hotel in Houston and did not happen
@AmericanAir @USAirways y'all just lost a customer. Delayed flight. was assured we'd make connecting. connecting took off early. #GRIMEYSHIT
@deltaassist is there anyway to get a call back from customer service? Been on hold for over 25mins. this normal? I dialed the 800-323-2323
@AmericanAir @USAirways both suck. Was delayed to destination. which made our bag arrive late. Now our departure flights is delayed 4 hours
@AmericanAir How about some flights to STL from ORD?  2 hour delay on inbound is a 15 hour delay RT. Flew SWest instead
@united I thought you guys pride yourself in customer care!! My shoes were stolen out of my luggage - after an hour the phone. still no help
So annoyed to hear the changes that will come to @JetBlue...why would you want to be like the rest of them!? #bummer #thumbsdown ðŸ˜‘
@united Friend called for change of flight. United wanted change fee of $1.250 per ticket. A joke and rip off. And there was room on flight
@XGN_Bloodz @AmericanAir same. And same fucking airline.
My favorite airline @VirginAmerica really failed me today... Thanking God that I am taking @Delta home! #unfriendlyskies
@united  4 "wait 30 minutes more". were kicked OUT the plane. No idea what will happen next. Attendants saying exactly that.Flight 1440 LAX
@AmericanAir my flight number is AA1295. What's going on? Why is the flight delayed? I'm getting no answers here at the gate!
Yo @AirTran &amp; @SouthwestAir you guys have THE worst customer service. No one seems to know anything... It's like being loyal to a brick.
@camerondallas @AmericanAir HELP HIM U SEE IT WTF IS UR DEAL UR SO RUDE
@Lufthansa_USA @united. were assigned better seats. But no communications and "over booked looking for volunteers to give up seats" = stress
@SouthwestAir are you guys hiring? Going to need a job soon after my employer fires me for all these late arrivals courtesy of your airline
@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty. wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
Alright @united you stranded us and ruined Christmas in LA last year. Edmonton to Denver then Boston. You got this #youhaveonejob
@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs late. but 5 hours later we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
@MichaelSkolnik @JetBlue I think they were rude to do so but I also think that this is an unfair question to @JetBlue.
@DeltaAssist Worst airline in today. Had been a loyal customer for over 30 years. They allow my bags 2 be either lost or stolen &amp; care less.
shame on you @united for not taking the responsibility of your flight attendant's discriminatory behavior. I am not flying with you again..
Once again screwed over by @united overly strict 45 min bag check policy at Dulles. Missed it by about 5 minutes.. Sigh
@united why not tell the truth about delays. I have 3 text messages with my flight delay and your company is still wrong.
@AmericanAir @ItsOnDonkeyKong now she is going to miss her connecting flight. as are countless others I'm sure
@AmericanAir American Airline is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had!
@KathyReichs @united didn't you get similar answer last time when flight delayed? :-(
Another mechanical delay on @united. For only being the 4th segment this year I am 50% mx.  Not how I like to travel.
@JetBlue today's flight1731 canceled &amp; now have worse seats for tomorrow's flight? Cmon guys you don't have to be jerks about this.
@united Dissatisfied customer #whycantyoubemorelikeyourbigbrotherdelta
@AmericanAir extremely disappointed with the service provided! Will not be recommending for international or domestic flights.
Hey @AmericanAir. It's too late to be stuck on the taxi at DFW. Last flights already left airport but we're waiting for a gate #45minalready
@SouthwestAir waiting for flight 4730 from Dallas to Austin. Clearly delayed but they are not sharing info.
@deltaassist your same day change policy is the worst. Ever. Looks like USAir will be getting my business.
@CWBYall @united also needs to know that overbooking a flt &amp; then bribing people to take a latter one sucks; I want to get home earlier!
@AmericanAir 6 hours and 2 cancelations l8r. EWK to ORD. 4 more hours to wait. What is going on?! Need to get there. http://t.co/8tWXCmslPc
@AmericanAir i was annoyed complaints couldn't be processed over twitter but followed your instructions - submitted on may 4. no response.
Highly disappointed in the new @JetBlue policies. http://t.co/fC1MoP59be
@DeltaAssist Booked two tickets together 2 months ago. Seat assignments are somehow lost for one of us on 5/17. Need help for adjacent seats
@BrowncoatPony @TriardtheFox @JetBlue Wow. pathetic. Adding bag fees. shrinking leg room? Sayonara. JetBlue.
@VirginAmerica why is your site failing?! Cc @Shevonne_S don't have a cyber Monday sale and a broken website!
@JMou_ @united you can claim for your Delayed flight- check here if you are entitled for compensation http://t.co/FhH5jb2cOy
@united lost bag in at 7:30pm for delivery still no bad. No help at desk 1k baggage
I mean... @united is always a bad idea ! #neveragain http://t.co/H1OKlU2Vnf
@united &amp; another 5+ hours of delays causing missed work. your pathetic $100 doesn't cover the loss of income you have caused &amp; my plane sat
@DeltaAssist @Delta if you know there is a departure delay why would you push the plane off the gate and make us sit on a taxiway? Dl1259
@DeltaAssist we had a late night flight around 11pm. too bad delta cs won't let parents to pre board. @Delta #notsoimpressedanymore
@united we were worried at first. we didn't leave #seatac until 730am when our flight was said to leave at 6am. But they got us back on time
My first time flying @United and my last time flying #United. Currently stuck on the Tarmac in Colo Springs and @united is doing nothing.
I guess @JetBlue wasn't kidding about the high call volume... 45 mins on hold for an issue that cannot be fixed online. #womp
@mpesce you can fly @united from SFO. I wouldnâ€™t (I go via NZ). but it is  an option. A horrible horrible option.
@HighTechTexan @SouthwestAir be careful . you may get kicked out of the plane
@SouthwestAir missed connection b/c of broken toilet on inbound BWI plane rebooked next day no food voucher no upgrade; OKC to STL to BOS :(
Hey @AlaskaAir I'm about to miss my connection from Seattle to Bozeman due to a delay in SF. Can you guys rebook me on the next flight?
@DeltaAssist @Delta Husband on flight 1308. which is delayed and needs to make connection to flight 1521 ATL to DAY. Help?
@AmericanAir Why was flight 1154 from DFW to MSP cancelled?
@united if my flight that was supposed to land at 6:40 is cancelled due to weather at EWR why would a flight that lands at 9 get in?
Poor customer service again by @SouthwestAir who reached out to assist then blew me off on change needed within 48hrs #customerservice #fail
@USAirways @AmericanAir  - Please answer your phone.  6hrs on hold and counting.  #goingforthrrecord http://t.co/8UN7RmOuzH
@united Actually you don't. It said "non-refundable" nowhere on my reciept/ticket and the rules were hidden behind a faulty CAPTCHA page.
@AmericanAir US AIR flight 438 delay and captain can't get in touch with maintenance?
@SouthwestAir been on hold for the last 35 mins. Can i get some LUV and speak to a rep please?
@mccrory @united Because THEY LIE
@SouthwestAir ugh why did you push back releasing the air schedule to November 10th? Many spring breakers are still looking for flights!
@SouthwestAir been on hold with customer service number for 20 minutes now. trying to change my flight bc of snow and nobody is answering!
@united so you would rather leave empty economy seats. instead of letting loyal customers have them. even though the flight is not full?
@united when is flight 1507 from sfo to Vegas leaving? We've been delayed 90 minutes already and are just sitting at the gate
@united you cancelled out con. Flight mid flight. We could not rebook until we landed
@AmericanAir @crysctanner CS unwilling to help. bags have been lost for 3 days. I was told there is nothing else they can do.#goingforgreat
Oh no delayed an hour :( @AmericanAir
So who is held accountable when a missing security search form delays an entire flight @VirginAmerica  #vn922
@united worst airline!! They agreed to refund our $1.270 for a ticket to Australia. 3 days later an email NO. Can't get any help! J0NZ6M
@SouthwestAir  why arrive early if you have to sit on the ramp waiting for a gate?  #buymoregates
@_AmandaWyss @united I see nothing but bad things about United. Remind me to never fly with them if I'm ever in the US.
@SouthwestAir Still waiting for bags to be loaded for takeoff 40+ mins after scheduled. Likely to miss connecting flight.
@JetBlue fuck you!! #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue #BoycottJetBlue
@SarahBlackwood1 @united that's ridiculous! We used @JetBlue a yr ago. he cried the whole flight. We weren't kicked. I even breastfeed him!
Hello @SouthwestAir when the plane is nowhere in site &amp; it's 20 minutes past "takeoff" time maybe "on-time" is no longer accurate
@USAirways @AmericanAir your systems are really annoying.  Why do I have two airlines and two confirmation numbers for one flight #horrible
@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen. that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.
@SouthwestAir - rewards website is not working and I can't book rental car. 3 redirects on your help line but no real "help." What now?!
Will NEVER buy airplane wifi again! So SLOW!!! It's not worth the $8 I paid! @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir Just now accidently booked part of award flight when entire trip would be same # of miles.can I add missing leg w/o change fee?
@AmericanAir told me I missed Platinum status challenge by a day because agent placed wrong date for start. Was on track for EP. #deltabound
@MCO Hey. our bags went missing on @AmericanAir flight from MCO-MIA on Sat. Please help locate them. I need medication from my bag
@ShowMeYourAura focus on the big picture instead of getting lost in some temporary details  http://t.co/cJ0R6N2U3Y @xanaduserl @Sia @united
@SouthwestAir SWA Flight 179. This is my 4th cancelled flight and third time on hold for more than 1 hour.... Can someone please help me?!
@united worst company ever
.@united IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER.  GOTTA PAY TO WATCH THIS BUMMY SCREEN IN THIS TINY SEAT? C'MON SON. #SMH
UA1274 was delayed and caused us to miss all flights to Aukland. The only compensation we get is a room and $14 in meal vouchers? @united
Poor on @united not to honour tickets purchased during yest's glitch. It's not the customer's fault. @thepointsguy #unitedmusthonortickets
So 6 Hour delay due to mechanical issues gets you what @united flight 5406
My friend's @SouthwestAir flight was delayed until 1:40am. My wife drops her off @CHS_Airport at 11:20pm. Airport closed. won't let her in
@united Still waiting on my #refund for those upgraded seats on my #cancelled #united #flight #UA934 last week. #unitedfail #ididntforget
How hard will @united work to provide a rational refund amount? We'll know once the inconvenience caused is settled #90minutesInALine #At2am
Thank you Wall Streets so-called analysts! You ruin @JetBlue for many passengers! Only @SouthwestAir is holding on to free bags in 2015!
@SouthwestAir I hate you.
Due to an error by @united the few hundred dollars spent to have my daughter home for the holiday who is a soldier is wasted.
@georgina_leighc @united tell me about it. They have the worse veggie meals too. The planes are so old fashioned and their crew x
@AmericanAir cancelled my flight *again*.  On hold w/customer service for 1.5hrs and counting.  I think they just want to see me cry.
@DeltaAssist please help! My nonstop BNA-JFK just got switched to an awful layover. This really sucks. as I need to get back to NYC earlier
@united Just got interrogated at the United Club Chicago. #UnitedAirlines #rude #PoorForm
@united get my issue??
Why was I not upgraded to first class on either of my flights? I had to fly out a day late cuz of cancelations! #notfair @united
@united airlines sucks. 2 people in first class and they refused to upgrade anyone.
In case you forgot. I hate @AmericanAir &amp; their incompetent. rude &amp; useless employees. #thatsall ✈️🔫
@KTrevor @JetBlue Delays suck - fortunately. the party isn't stopping anytime soon! Safe travels and see ya soon!
@AmericanAir Bad experience checking I just now. PHX. Moved me to middle seat. Split up family. Agent rude. ZTGBVA.
SHAME on @united for their ignorance and mishandling of an autistic child on one of their flights. Ridiculous. See http://t.co/BLWOacnLrS
Since I've worked at MEC I've been on 164 @United flights and never encountered the issue I'm having on this 1 @SouthwestAir flight
Frustrated with @united correcting an error that is their fault. Now I can't select the seats even though I had them confirmed and paid.
@DeltaAssist help me!!!! I've tried to upgrade my seat for tomorrow 3 times! It keeps showing an error message and I've been on hold forever
@PeteWalen despite multiple texts and emails from @united warning me of potential problems. yes.
Never had something stolen out of my checked bag...guess there's a first time for everything @united @TSA small item. but it's still theft
@TSAmedia_RossF @AmericanAir it's the same info I've used all year for my flights. I will call back to triple check but frustrating
@AmericanAir did you merge with us airways? I tweeted at them but received no response
@AmericanAir THIS IS THE LAST TIME I fly with you.  My bag has now been lost for 14 hours and your staff is incompetent
What do you mean all flights to SFO are delayed for 3+ hours @united I have a connecting flight to catch!!!
@JenSelter they are just nasty and that is so wrong. Shame on you @AmericanAir
â€œ@RonanFarrow: Way to go w/ the cuisine. American Airlines http://t.co/6U6IBzp8Ujâ€ @AmericanAir has the worst food Last resort airline 4 me
Come on @united .. 35 minutes and counting to get flight 1247 to a gate in IAH. No gate available?? Really? #sad #badservice

@AlaskaAir #AlaskaAirlinesSucks Cancer Patient. Kicked Off Alaska Airlines Flight http://t.co/016gcKKyvW
@united really poor customer service experience on a recent flight + a form letter response. I expected better. #disappointing
hey @jetblue can you help me with a reservation? been on hold for half hour already...
@JacobHallrtr @united worst airline ever. I'd rather drive across the country. Flown with them 3 times. All 3 = delays and lost luggage
@DeltaAssist We only noticed the damage (rip) at home. I issued the complaint asap. We had no response at all! http://t.co/YyWEMaW6QG
Terribly disappointed in @SouthwestAir. Waited for months for sister's visit. Flight #358 delayed. she was "voluntold" to get off.
@united UA303 is the best example of when I will from now on pay extra to fly @delta or @American. Look at my fly history: bad UA service
I will never fly with @AmericanAir again they have ruined my senior trip that me and my class have worked for
Another terrible experience with @united. rude agents forcing me to check a TSA approved size carryon while others bring musical instruments
@united where's the "what can we do to make up for your bad experience?" #unitedairlinessucks fly @SouthwestAir or @JetBlue they care
Delays! Delays! Delays! Ugh! I hope the passenger they had to remove off of my flight is okay! #312 to #305 @united @fly2ohare
@TaylorTwellman @OrlandoCitySC @united @JetBlue you just don't want it bad enough
Long trip over a large part of the planet flying @united! Looking forward to it. but starting off with whats prob gonna be 1hr delay sux!
@DeltaAssist I'm still waiting for my bags 2be delivered from Rochester airport. I have received conflicting info .  I need an est TBD time
@DeltaAssist what happens if int flight delayed over 4 hrs. Still stuck in JFK.
@VirginAtlantic @VirginAmerica Tweeted yesterday have had no response :( a simple no would have sufficed rather than be ignored.
@TeamRobS you live in Seattle and you've never flown @AlaskaAir?!? How the hell do you manage that? That are &gt;50% of Seatac departures!
I need @DeltaAssist to discount the wifi pass when one of your flights that day has no wifi capability.
Why can't you rebook a cancelled flight online @AmericanAir ?
@VirginAmerica I love you guys. but your new flight booking website is awful. Makes it really hard to find the best flight option :
.@JetBlue  you've lost my friend Sasha as a loyal customer. Make it right please http://t.co/IdL3r1iqvY
Some disappointments @USAirways @AmericanAir Please fix these issues. #US718 #PHL to #FCO http://t.co/8oP7Ofsc3C
@united @anneshurl's flight to Chicago for tomorrow morning was cancelled. She's been on hold for over half an hour. Please help her!
@SouthwestAir. literally every time I fly #Southwest out of Ontario. my 1hr flight has been delayed over 2 hrs! #unacceptable. #flight361
@Cdubble @AmericanAir @USAirways gotta fuck with @VirginAmerica or @AlaskaAir ðŸ™ðŸ™
Ok so @AmericanAir lost one of my bags at from my chicago-Heathrow flight and im freaking out
Here we go again... @united is delayed again... I don't see why I have to pay a $200 change fee if they are not going to be on time!!
@JetBlue your app stinks as the last few weeks. Flight status says no flights found. constantly. Good thing @flightaware is working.
#sfo bad weather. flights cancelled behind us. but we found a window. But..wait. what? -- GET OUT OF THE LAVATORY- TIME TO GO @AmericanAir
Stuck in Orlando Airport for God knows how long b.c @AmericanAir decided to depart early &amp; screw over anyone who was stuck in security lines
@janet_chung @LisaVanderpump @RobertNBCLA @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom So what's up @Delta?! Find the dog!!! Your airlines sucks!
Come on jet blue! Get us off this plane!! Sitting here waiting for another plane to leave gate at raleigh.nc @JetBlue
Bummed. waiting for a @Delta red eye now because I couldn't check in 30 mins before my original flight to my. @DeltaAssist
Hey @united. what's up with the #debacle surrounding flight UA1001? Just a mess here at Cancun International. http://t.co/YtfLugTJsA
Both times I have flown @SouthwestAir have been an absolute shitshow and a huge inconvenience because they ~don't assign seats~
@SouthwestAir trying to get through to customer service. have been waiting for over an hour on the phone. need to confirm canceled flight
@kristen @united this is shocking. Breastfeeding is nothing to be ashamed of. I hope he's made and example of! Shitstain!
I think @TheChainsmokers have convinced me enough to never take @united air lines.
@united If crews r a limited resource &amp; they r causing u to fail your paid customers. then increase the # of resources available to work.
@JetBlue I have to travel intl to India with several connecting flights. And you guys cancelled my flight to JFK
DAMMIT!!!  gonna miss my daughter's talent show this afternoon. Been gone 3 weeks and I promised I'd be there. @AmericanAir fails again.
I will NEVER do business with @JetBlueAirlines @JetBlue  EVER again completely rude and unprofessional they have ZERO customer service!
A little disappointed that despite my full fare first class ticket I'm not permitted to use the @AlaskaAir club room at #PHX
@AmericanAir what a surprise not enough characters available 4 my complaint just as i suspected.. Please provide me with an alternative
Worst part of @united express flight being delayed and being bussed to IAD: losing Pre-Check.  I wonder if IAD would accept my BWI brd pass.
@united I have a four hour layover in Houston. flying to bwi. Why do you guys always put me in boarding group 5? You guys must hate me.
@AmericanAir- my daughter had a horrible three days. 3 cancel flights.  2 delays. Trip from chi to Paris. Customer svc stinks
@RaqibMarvelous @JetBlue That's fucking rude.... send them this http://t.co/GQgj56j5LZ
@americanair it's been 2 weeks since I emailed refunds for the status on processing my refund for my cancelled flight. nothing but silence.
@United. I know I'm only a lowly premier silver. but when you stuck me with a 7-hour layover. you could have comped me United Club access.
@SouthwestAir any idea why the internet on your flight today is so bad? it won't even let me go to the southwest website!
@AmericanAir I wait for the TWA - any date yet?
@AlaskaAir Thanks. Everyone is being nice. Just frustrated because this obv could have been planned better
@united The one who needed assistance was @chuggaconroy - he had his luggage either lost or on another airplane 4 of his last 6 flights.
Would Smart #Travel Solutions Find My #Luggage. Which  @united  Lost? http://t.co/bpzYFg2rse via @techcrunch
@AmericanAir since when was common sense a limiting agent in airline protocol. Email or messenger pigeon next time you cancel my itinerary?
@SouthwestAir . why you always gotta delay? 😩 I have a connected flight today 😩😩😩
A little @jetblue disappointment damage control email for this evening. . . #airlines #travel #dontchange
@AmericanAir This flight (1031 6 pm from PITTSBURGH) misses the mark EVERY Thursday.  In 5 months of flying weekly it never leaves on time.
@SouthwestAir so I am tweeting for a friend. MDW to BWI flight cancelled. wait til we r on the plane to cancel. really? Can someone DM me
@SouthwestAir stuck in BWI customs for over an hour because our bags have yet to arrive! And to boot. no one is around to help us!#flight832
@VirginAmerica How can a great airline like VA leave flight 404 waiting for 2 hours on EWR Tarmac? Really?
@MixedSemaphore @AmericanAir @dfwairport and get people to load bags. Beyond ridiculous tonight. #airportfailure
@united is the giftcardexchange website running? Is there a solution to my travel issues?

@united you are killing my vacation vibes! Brand new plane &amp; broken restrooms? #NeverAgain #shouldhaveflowndelta #LetsMove #hawaiineedsme
@united worst airline ever. I called to inquire about a later flight and then decided to not make any changes. Of course they screwed me.
@SouthwestAir has some of the worst employees.Learn to show some concern for their flyers &amp; not be sittin in the office on your phones #rude
Flying @AmericanAir is always a bad decision. If not for @MAS. they would easily be in last place.
My @AmericanAir flight was stuck in  takeoff posistion for 15 minutes because the runway lights were out. @Delta  hustled a flight out early
Dear @JetBlue. thx for cancelling my mom's flight via EMAIL an hour before she was to go. And rescheduling it for MONDAY. Now a 30min hold.
@SouthwestAir your customer service is the worst in travel. Can't believe you would treat a customer this way.
@united EVERYTIME I fly this airline there is always an issue. Been at baggage claim for over 30 minutes. No bags. AND you charge for this!!
@KarenCierra @united They lost your Luggage? Or it's  actually their cust Service its really bad'?
Tried to switch my @United flight to 4 different times today from Houston to Newark. None had wi-fi. It’s 2015. How is that possible?
@TysonApostol @Delta @DeltaAssist @DeltaNewsroom dude what the fuck? Thats horrible...
@greggutfeld @VirginAmerica Same w/Comcast. Waited 55 minutes on the phone &amp; they disconnected the call. I won the battle. they won the war.
It's too late. Since @SouthwestAir couldn't get me home in a timely manner I had to switch airlines. Frustrating and unfortunate experience.
@AlaskaAir at Logan term C-no precheck-no restaurant-no airline club-very bad move Alaska!
@united is the most incompetent airline i've ever flown. i don't remember the last time i flew with them and didn't have a flight delayed
@DeltaAssist I need help on forwarding some delayed luggage. It's stuck in NYC since Saturday. HELP PLEASE!
@SouthwestAir - unbelievably bad customer service - only ONE parent w a child during fam boarding. and on Veterans Day! How can this be?
.@united just cancelled my flights w/ no explanation and no offer of rebooking NOR a number to call to rebook. Insane.
@united #ua127 diverting to @ShannonAirport is a medical diversion. Pax with heart problem.
Like I'm not even mad @united I just want u to get the help u need while also returning all my things to me in a reasonable time period
@SouthwestAir Goodbye!  Your reduced flight schedule is no longer convenient for me from LIT to DAL.  I drive instead. Get home quicker.
@delta @DeltaAssist seriously delta?!! You are THE worst airline!!!
@DeltaAssist  DL1109 been waiting on bags almost 40 minutes.  Will be looking for 2500 mile credit.
I used to like you @AmericanAir. Today you've been a mess.
I know Iâ€™m awesome and all. but Bay Area let me leave already! @virginamerica
@ilikecomicstoo Maybe I should switch to taking @JetBlue
@AmericanAir u shouldn't have done that to @jeromejarre ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” what a mess! Was it REALLY necessary??
.@AmericanAir I have never had such awful service in my life. customer service woman hung up on me after I asked to speak to her supervisor.
Jetblue adding bag fees. cutting legroom...:( #jetblue  @JetBlue  you are destroying what makes you great..
Airlines are ridiculous. @united charges $75 to fly standby when it would save them $ (freeing up my seat for later overbooked flight)
Looks like I'm stuck in Austin for lunch. my @AmericanAir plane lies broken at DFW. Hoping its just the cabin heater and not the engines...
@united I wish bags would make it on the same flight taken. #frustrated
Why is it that there is never wifi on @SouthwestAir flight from LAX to STL?  Should be mandatory on flights longer than 90 mins!!
@united You are awful today. Mechanical failure. Delays. Staff walks away while customers wait to get new connections. No announcements.
@AlaskaAir ASSHOLES! http://t.co/7EdpaRxyq3 Karma guys-just karma.  shame. shame shame on you indeed.
Wait... @SouthwestAir is playing Outkast in its commercials. I am now a fan of both. #SoFreshandSoClean
That seems really odd @AmericanAir. We are sitting on the Tarmac in queue for takeoff...
Possibly gonna miss our flight cause of super slow bag check in at Boston. Thanks @JetBlue.
@AaronStrout @SouthwestAir Had the same issue two weeks ago. Wonder if it was global for them.
@AmericanAir I want compensated for the inconvenience and 7 hour loss of my vacation.
Hey @DeltaAssist. when did your phone agents get so rude? Agent got frustrated when I called to verify check-in b/c web site said I wasn't
@AmericanAir flight  2267 from Chicago to lax has had 3 broken planes. I don't understand how that is possible. Y'all had one job
@americanair I paid $68 extra for a seat on #AA2360 only to be stuck with a inoperable window shade and the stench of urine in the air #AA

#somewhereidratherbe anywhere but an @AmericanAir flight. Delayed for the billionth time #neveragain
When you're trying to book a flight from @SouthwestAir &amp; it tells you the price went up in the process of filling out info thats ridiculous
Delay of 5 hours and counting. Why don't we call it a day. @united and you find me a flight to Chicago?
@DeltaAssist It wasn't a wait FOR the bag; I was simply trying to check it in before my flight and even the agent said it is poorly set up
@DeltaAssist my flight is delayed in clt. Please message me about my connecting flight.
Landed 30 minutes ago on a @united flight and still no bags at the baggage claim. Literally no other flights around us #sofun #goodmorning
2 different @AmericanAir agents advised stand by to get home. Get here and now 2more are telling me of a charge. Horrible service from all.
@ColleenB123 @AmericanAir why is every airline awful?

@AlaskaAir @teeearls I'll be eating those in &lt;10 minutes. On incoming Tarmac now
Hey @united . putting all these new seats in Ur Airbus is like putting new sheets in a motel 6. It still sucks.
They left our bags in heavy rain &gt;15min...everything is soaked. @SouthwestAir says if it's not "damaged". too bad. ðŸ˜¡ http://t.co/TITcpkxGbb
Ur flight attendants are not "allowed" to help me lift up my carry on to the overhead bin? What if you have issues lifting it? @AmericanAir
Whoa! @SouthwestAir this is terrible. You better really. really review internal policy and fire that attendant. http://t.co/b6E3cVc1Ni
@WandrMe people are awful. @JetBlue should be commended for what they did for our nations bravest

2nd time in 2 months I've had problems flying on @americanair that wound up costing me hundreds of dollars more.
@united needs to learn how to better handle passengers with autism.  That article was disgusting!  Your company should be sued.
Amazingly terrible @united customer service. We bought our tickets together and you split up our seats. No process to fix that?
@HamzahMaqbul @AmericanAir PHL is the worst airport I've ever been at. Gate agents go out of their way to be rude and discriminatory there
Tried to book award travel w/ @AmericanAir but can't bc apparently I am only 4 yrs old. But I've been a member for 6 yrs. Computer #fail.
The @AmericanAir and @USAirways merger was the worst thing to happen to flyers. Can't check in on either kiosk. Must make 30 min line.
I REALLY wish someone from @SouthwestAir or @TSA  would explain how a brand new designer watch was stolen from our luggage???
@aloria There's a reason that never flying @united again is on my "Raven Life List" (things to do nevermore). http://t.co/CalGjBbN2L
Yuck stuck at BWI @AlaskaAir flight 767 delayed 1.5 hours.  Want to go home.  What's the delio.
@shawcommaryan @united they are slow to respond to this!
After long week and long trip home. I discovered items in my checked baggage were stolen by "security." @AmericanAir employs criminals.
@ChrisHarrisJr @SouthwestAir oh man bro that sucks! Hope you find it
@DeltaAssist flight 5060 to CLT is delayed. Can you please back us up on the next flight.
Major fail @united on flight 1424 from Rdu.  Mech problems twice. on the same plane?
@DeltaAssist it's all good...just hot. They made the announcement that it's broken.
I don't even fly @united anymore. but they continue to be a PITA. Dropped segments on an award ticket. On hold trying to fix #FlyerFriendly
@AmericanAir Our flight was cancelled 3hrs ago. why aren't you calling ME to fix this? #EndlessLine #TerribleService
@united hope the captain that decided to kick an an autistic girl off his plane becomes the parent of an autistic child!
I bought maze runner on my @SouthwestAir flight and it kept cutting out and I didn't finish! I'm stuck in suspense. so sad. how does it end!
@AmericanAir looks like I'm going to misconnect due to maintenance issue. Can you protect me on next flight?
If you ever get stuck flying coach. @AlaskaAir and @recarousa new seats are seriously the stuff of economy #travel dreams @tripchi #sweet
FUCK YOU DELTA FUCK ALL MY LOYALTY TO YOU. FOR NOTHING. FUCK YOU @Delta @DeltaAssist
@dfwairport @SydneyAirport Can't wait! @AmericanAir @Qantas @QantasUSA
Hey @united &amp; @AmericanAir Please find my lost bag. What could happen between AUSTIN &amp; ONT???
@DeltaAssist I've gotten no help with cancelled flights and was supposed to get call back and never did. Very disappointed
@AmericanAir 1605 and you just cancelled it!
@AmericanAir worst customer service experience
@DeltaAssist I need to make change to flight today. called Delta. 57 min wait. Options?
Landed in Portland to catch my connecting flight and found out it's been cancelled. Thanks @AlaskaAir  #awesome #jetsetter
.@VirginAmerica thanks. apparently my 2 bags that were damaged in transit are not Virgin's liability. 2 damaged bags. 1 trip seems excessive
@HaymakerHattie @JetBlue I sure the price went up also.  Hate airlines.  That's why my husband is studying to get his private pilot license.
United @united STINKS!  They made my son miss a wedding on NYE because of an ignorant gate agent and only give a lousy $50 voucher?
@DeltaAssist is anyone answering phine today? 1.5 hours on hold so far.
@AmericanAir Day 9. no response!  How long does it take to "do a careful review"?
@maradydd Bloody hell. I was already keeping away from @united. but this sort of shit makes me reconsider rejoining any Star Alliance line.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold waiting for you to answer me for 1 hour 40 minutes... Fancy picking up before I die? http://t.co/jR7hQnMu2w
@united - why is our flight the only flight delayed 3+ hrs due to "air traffic issues"
Just boarded my @united flight SD- Washington Dulles. 6+hr flight and no TVs ? #ouch....
@united why ru doing everything possible 2 make my canceled flight w a toddler WORSE?! Looka like @JetBlue is where 2b 😭❄️✈️#noplacelikehome
@united I guess I don't spend enough on your airline as this was the "seat" waiting for me for my flight #688 SFO-ORD. #WTFMoments
@AmericanAir Flight from CLT to JFK delayed by weather. going to miss connection on Emirates. Neither airline is on the hook for weather 1/3
@AmericanAir over 40 minutes and our entire flight still doesn't have bags at PHL. USAirways 2026. Mechanical problems with cargo door?!
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir. glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
I believe @united is trying to kill me at the terminal of LAX with endlessly looped tiny snippets of Rhapsody in Blue. Torture most foul.
First time flying @united and I'll never do it again. The dude next to me is puking in the barf bag and they wouldn't let me move seats!!!
Note to self never fly @SouthwestAir again because you will be delayed for hours every. single. time.
@AmericanAir has the WORST customer service EVER!!! TWO weeks I've been dealing with YOUR mistake!!! #LIVID #advantagemembershipisajoke
@SouthwestAir just checked in for my flight tomorrow @ 910pm. automatically got hit w a delay. #neverfailswithSW
Oh @united canceled my direct flt to Lihue now stuck on Tarmac for 1hr &amp; u say it could b another hr.  Any better airlines for hire?
1 hour delay... and still haven't left come on @AlaskaAir sure you can do better. That's the 3rd time out of the last 5 flights it's delayed
@AmericanAir said they found our bags and sent only one. from a guy flying Saudi Arabia Airlines. Ruined our vacation. Still no bags.
@united #worstExperienceEver #liars no meal as promised no connecting flight no compensation #worst-airline #NoCustomerService/loyalty
after several days &amp; if all the stars align. I will be reunited with my long lost *boo  ...oops. I mean *bag @united
Don't know what @united are doing. Told me they would be in touch 'shortly'. that was 48hrs ago with a response on lost luggage.
@DeltaAssist Why do I have to wait to get to check in with agent to get an assigned seat? I'm not able to do it online or with app
Hour 2 of 5 with this as my IFE screen. @DeltaAssist . FAs no help. Talk about miserable flying. #platinumproblems http://t.co/SJOd8eiNoW
@delta gave you Another chance even though every flight w u has been fucked and again 1 hr delay today to LAX @deltaassist #theworst #delay
@united Yeah. but now I'm waiting for a 3 hour delayed departure because you're not sufficiently staffed at IAD.
@AmericanAir help- is flight 1564 from Phoenix to chicago cancelled or not- the gate agents say yes the board say no
@mashable Fuck @JetBlue  .. Worst customer service ever
Second time in 3 months my @JetBlue flight is delayed by almost 2 hours. I just wanted a relaxing weekend! #ugh #getittogether cc @WKidston
Ben Fairfield on Twitter: "MajorFAIL #2 in the same night @AlaskaAir. Lost our luggage both... http://t.co/H7SAi3LSDe
@JetBlue You should hire me to redesign what happens to people when a JetBlue flight gets canx. Worst user experience ever.
@VirginAmerica  Sucks. they can't even send email alerts regarding flight delays.
@southwestair changes to sjc-&gt;pdx schedule are awful! no choice but to move to @AlaskaAir.  sucks.
@united Need help! A friend is trying to leave San Juan at 4pm with his GF for an emergency MRI in LA tonight but can't get a seat with her
@AmericanAir  I have been on hold for 13 hours when will I get through #onhold
You guys customer service is terrible. if I have it my way I will never fly w/ you guys again! 😡 @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir my backpack with my underwears is missing smh
@AmericanAir flight cancelled for no apparent reason. then I GET a call from an agent who tells me straight up that he can't help #ucalledme
@SouthwestAir YOUR WIFI ISNT WORKING AND IM VERY UPSET
@DeltaAssist can you help ? Trying to get to Rome from Milan. Flight 1017 cancelled. William abernathy
Gotta say. really frustrating that @AmericanAir's phone system automatically hung up on me twice since all specialists were busy.
"@gsterling: What's worse than no onboard WiFi? @united WiFi. Having AOL dial-up flashbacks. Wasted hours ...  #firstworldproblems
Hungover... Waiting on @AmericanAir to get this thing going... ✈️ #hungover #ineedadrink #please http://t.co/keov1RRuOk
@DeltaAssist flight 3911 out of Newark cancelled and I need to get back to LA.
@AmericanAir No you really don't care at all. Look at your horrid ratings on Facebook. and complainants post the same stories.
Yo @AmericanAir I'm waiting on my call back! you said 15min-22min. it's been 25!
@omarsuleiman504 @Belalmd12 its a shame on United Airlines for such discrimination. boycott this United Airline for their behavior @united
@JetBlue epic fail - no inflight entertainment on flight 1 today - wtf - would have put a movie on the iPad
Disgusting discrimination and profiling. Not flying @united until they apologize to her.  #unitedfortahera http://t.co/eh0aqz8lXE
@lvelyz @imraansiddiqi @omarsuleiman504 she did name the airline -- @united. And I will never fly them again. This is disgusting &amp; awful.
@BlameTelford @AmericanAir Ugh I'm sorry! If you can switch to Southwest it's worth it. I'm never flying anything else again if possible.
@southwestair $500 groomens suit $200 gift missing rehearsal dinner BC no AC on flight....pathetic
@united sat in Newark for 4 hours could have driven home in 2 but agent had NO info terrible typical crap from United
http://t.co/j28rIHmDpS Deplaned for being #autistic ? Shame on you @united your pilot needs educated.
Hey @AmericanAir. how about sending a ground crew to B46 so I can deplane my  2 hour delayed flight?
@united  Again late airplane! This time waiting over an hour for someone to fly plane. More &amp; more disappointed with service.
@AirlineFlyer @martyw1981 I was on a @united flight that landed so early once at LAX. we lost it all waiting for the gate to open.
@AmericanAir stepped it up today huge...waiting on @united to do the same. Especially considering they're the real problem here...
@nathankillam @quintanarootri @united glad you got help.  My point is what the hell are the bike fees for if not to help prevent this?
@united Day 4 NO BAGS..very disappointed with service. Not sure what I could have done differently.
@DeltaAssist Where is my lost item? I never heard back from the lost+found team. It's been 3 weeks now. I want my item back :(
@AmericanAir Over an hour delayed w/ no explanation. 20 min ago pilot said prepare 4 takeoff but here we sit. At least @Delta gives u pizza
@AmericanAir I have been on hold for 45 minutes trying to book a new flight after mine were canceled. Any idea on phone wait times?
REALLY disappointed in @KCIAirport &amp; @SouthwestAir for leaving our luggage out in the POURING RAIN to the point where everything's SOAKED.
@AmericanAir you check in process is terrible. Next you will be having us load our own luggage onto the plan.
@united Your fees for canceling/changing flights are ridiculous and unrealistic. Sincerely. lost customers
Really late @JetBlue flight...I don't get to enjoy #MemorialDay with family OR friends. I'm stuck in limbo. Thanks. JetBlue. Thanks...
Are you serious @AmericanAir??? You can't just cancel my flight then say "deal with it." Military personnel need to actually be on time
By far the worst travel experience that I have ever had! Very disappointed in how @united handled the situation!
@JetBlue @united @AmericanAir @Delta American Airlines are the worst to travel now a days.Dirty airlines. no legrooms.&amp; bad customer service
@RangaEunny @motabhaai @IndiGo6E me INR 500 voucher. Last month my @SouthwestAir was delayed by one hour because of some security (2/n)
@DocHousel @SouthwestAir That's ridiculous!!
@SouthwestAir terrible service updates on flight AUS-LAS. 30 min mechanic paperwork?  Don't lie. just tell us what's happening
@AlaskaAir rebooked with American but my bag never made it!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡
.@JetBlue Just so you know. I've been a loyal JB flyer since the beginning; y'all were my airline of choice. Never again. #FJB
Wow. @JetBlue is only airline @KendraBradner &amp; I use. No longer. Uncool. Blue. "JetBlue Cuts Leg Room. Adds Bag Fees" http://t.co/zk9yCjfgAJ
@SouthwestAir we made it luggage and all! A few hours late but where is the excitement in being on-time
@united can't believe my Mon redeye from sfo to jfk already cancelled. @AmericanAir flying the redeye and not panicking over light snow!
@rstanzel @SouthwestAir Ugh. And traveling with a 4 year old. Cannot even imagine the frustration!
Hey. @AmericanAir. we're suffering on flight 1385 because your decal fell off. Water please.
I am so annoyed with @SouthwestAir
@JetBlue The app says 40 minute delay. the website says it's on time. Who do I believe? Flight 0777 BOS &gt; LAS
@SouthwestAir @united @DeltaAssist @USAirways @AmericanAir  Seriously. you all suck.
@CynSearly We had a 5h layover at JFK @JetBlue #T5 yesterday. Usually 5h would suck but there is a really good sushi/ramen resto there.
Hate when the airline completely changes my flights and airports when trying to fly home - Arghhhh 😒✈️ #travelissues @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist my wife is having a hell of a time getting out of Canada. She was there in Emry of time and they have her seat away.
@SouthwestAir flights cancelled.  No clue why. no one is answering the phone &amp; on hold 20 mins. Web not working.  better ways to reach u?
_@CNNMoney: Next time you fly @JetBlue. better get ready for bag fees and cramped seats http://t.co/Q7gGBvt9TA http://t.co/VZiMSoUhvr_ oops!
@AmericanAir tremendous. too bad i fly @Delta
Jazzed to pay @AmericanAir $200 to cancel almost sure 2 b snowed out flight home 4 Xmas. Sure theyll find a better use for $$ than my gifts
@JetBlue thanks for the worst #travel experience ever. taking 3 days to get me home: http://t.co/Rxryk3VXPr
@AlaskaAir flight 309 it was delayed I missed my entire shift and I'm getting written up can I get a letter of explanation for my boss
@AmericanAir one hour 5 minutes and still on hold. Absurd.
This @AmericanAir stewardess is rude as can be to me. Accused me of not understanding English.
Hey @JetBlue. about to fly from JFK to SFO and after an unannounced hour delay. my reading light is broken. #helpme
@united the problem was TIME OF THE CREW. IT WASNT THE WEATHER! Other flights in the same time were leaving.
@AmericanAir any update on when #5046 will leave CLT for ILM ?
@united if I didn't have 150k mileage points. I'd never fly your airline again. A rotten experience of delay after delay w/ minimal notice.
@WineFoot @COMP461 Will never fly @AmericanAir again. I put them in my bio as warning. They gave me 15.000 miles as apology. Still won't fly
@united Why would a flight to Israel cost $200 more from Newark. NJ than one from Washington. DC to Newark to Israel?!! That is insane!
So will @AlaskaAir take the Seahawks home. or are they stuck hitchhiking? At least they can box to raise some bus fare.
Stuck on Tarmac in Chicago@Americanair no gates available looks like I won't get to use my one day Admiral's Club pass
Yet another story why the airline industry (and @United. specifically) is terrible. http://t.co/OcZRL0pK9O who cares if she changes seats?
Ticket I want on @United costs $106 to buy straight up. They want to charge me $191 to switch from my $617 itinerary to cheaper one. #Merica
@VirginAmerica Flight 23 grounded &amp; was supposed to take off over 2hrs ago &amp; they say another hr delay to go. Free champagne for the flight?
@ericandre they never writhe with ecstasy. ever. They work for @AmericanAir
Hey @united. remember when you kicked me off a plane because the people who booked it can't count so there were no seats left?
Back to basics @united waiting 35 minutes for a bag after a 12 hour journey #Painful
36hours since we left our first airport. now we are sitting on yet another delayed @united airlines flight. We just want to get home. #lame
@AmericanAir  late Arrivals to and from.  Lost luggage both ways.   5 gate changes at DFW.   Dates of travel were 12/23 &amp; 12/27.
@DeltaAssist day 4 no luggage. Baggage Services has no idea why I have not gotten luggage.  Admit you lost my bag!
Thinking of my poor experience with @DeltaAssist reminds me I'm still waiting for @SAS to reply re my complaint 7 months ago! So @SAS?
@united planes are falling apart. Retire the 767. No wifi no power in seat. no reason to fly #ual from GVA #787now http://t.co/ld65maGMvx
@SouthwestAir SUCKS where's my bag yo
Hey @united - How many times are you going to cancel my flight to Chicago and force me to miss more work?! #unacceptable #GETITRIGHT
@jsomething2 You know that they stop you doing that so you donâ€™t kill everyone elseâ€™s connection. yeah? @WandrMe @PanasonicAero @united
Been there. Sad @United MT @mattbai: The iPad I left on a plane last month? Someone found it. At my seat. where @united said they looked.
So @united you kicked an autistic child off bc she might become a threat? #autism #stupidity #overreaction
At @flyLAXairport waiting to check my bags  for @united where are their employees? http://t.co/60Ba8osKX3
@PHLAirport @AmericanAir @USAirways Ridiculous! Can't get through on phone to make changes. $1 minute to call from Mexico. On hold forever.
@united - bummed that the entertainment system is not working on my flight for my daughter.  Had high hopes.  Refund? http://t.co/I8C3DrPVWD
@AmericanAir really needs to work on there customer service. The negative attitudes are the worst and Always in play at LAX! #WHY
@united has worst service. Never seen such miscommunication in all my years of airline travel. Late flights. misinformed on plane arrivals.
@AmericanAir @USAirways sucks man... The entire 45 mins i stood in line to be told to move to another. then miss my flight. Hello @united
@AmericanAir is the worst! My flight to Chicago was cancelled due to a fire at Ohare. now I have to pay an extra $300 to rebook my flight
My connecting flight didn't wait the extra 5 minutes for me to get off my flight so I'm sitting in the airport for hours now. @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir my flight from Tampa to DC was delayed and I arrive almost 3 hours late and missed my connecting flight to NYC.
@DeltaAssist flight just landed in ATL now stuck on runway. connection leaves at 8. Any chance of making the connection?
@SouthwestAir disappointed you want to charge me more than my round trip to get on a (near empty) two hour earlier flight
@Delta @DeltaAssist so disappointed/disgusted with Delta flying experience last week MCO/JFK. Lost luggage. poor planning. #awful
Never flying with @united ever again Nope nope nope
@DeltaAssist ANSWER YOUR PHONES!!! 4 times this week I have spent more than 30 minutes on HOLD.  Totally Unacceptable Service!!!!
And a 3.5 hour delay on our return trip. just like our first leg. Sorry. @AlaskaAir but I'll have to try @JetBlue next trip.
@deltaassist terrible meal in biz class "beef pasta" DTW2Shanghai 1b on Sept 7. Way below Delta standards. Disappointing.
Both flights delayed tonight. Now no crew to push the plane back. @AmericanAir . my row volunteers to get out and give us a shove off.
@united it has been now about a month since you told me to contact  customer service for my lost bag. and I have had no response back.
Never flying @AmericanAir again. never have had this many problems with a round trip at all. You need to make your time changes more acurate
So I'm delayed on @SouthwestAir flight to laguardia until 6 because of storms...meanwhile in New York.... #nothing http://t.co/AixiJGOckc
@united Hanging up on customers seems like a terrible way to provide customer support.
This. RT @rbuike: You could have not screwed over my friend @runnrgrl RT @AmericanAir: @rbuike Oh no. Rodney. How can we help you?
Frustrated at Delta Airlines @Delta @DeltaAssist for canceling a family member's flight here for Thanksgiving.  That's just plain wrong!
More than 40 minutes waiting for a gate  @ MIA....  @AmericanAir
@DeltaAssist DL 1977 late. making me mis DL1965. I'd like to be standby on DL2518. Or is Delta paying for my stay in ATL tonight? 2425125891
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 30 minutes and still no answer..
@AmericanAir my flight for tomorrow was just cancelled.... What flights are available I need to get out tomorrow ASAP http://t.co/BxH0gm2d0p
@AmericanAir im stuck in richmond and I am going to miss my connect to incheon... How can I fix this before I get to DFW?
@AmericanAir I filed a claim. They said my bag made it to ORD but never to the carousel. Not yet located 16 hrs later.
@DeltaAssist who I can talk to about my situation. My flight got cancelled due to a "crew situation" &amp; nothing done to help? Follow for DM.
@united fucks up again. Delayed flight. Should have flown with @AlaskaAir
@AmericanAir  worst airline ever with the worst customer service. I don't understand how you guys keep operating.  What a joke.
@AmericanAir flight took off 5" after your response. Weird the same delay on the same route and for same reason happened in earlier flight
Apparently LGA is a mess today @AmericanAir --- pilot tells us 10 minutes. it's 30 and anyone could tell it's gonna be a while. #Airlines
@SouthwestAir Delay in MCI to ATL. How long is the delay from ATL to RSW? Will I have time to make my connecting flight?
@united #FAIL Arrive EWR terminal A. no signs bags @ terminal C REALLY?? GET A DAMN SYSTEM! #LOSTLUGGAGE  #LATE
@SouthwestAir  Don't tell me we are late because the plane is overweight and expect sympathy. Stop overlooking your flights!!!!
Ticket I want on @United costs $106 to buy straight up. They want to charge me $191 to switch from my $617 itinerary to cheaper one. #Merica
I've come to the conclusion @United just doesn't care anymore. Gate agents rude. flight attendant left plane before passengers #servicefail
Did @AmericanAir customer service just say they are too busy for my call and hang up on me? Never is that okay treatment for your customers
@united Too late! I will NEVER fly United again. Worst airlines ever!  I want the last 20 hours of my life back. #worstairlineever
3 flight delays due to mechanical out of four flights this week. Time to upgrade the fleet @AmericanAir
WE'RE DELAYED IN CHARLOTTE. I CANNOT BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN. Come on. @AmericanAir.
Another 3 hour delay @united
How is it that @united baggage claim at IAD is routinely one of the worst in the country?
Lost my glasses somewhere on the flight from Buffalo back to JFK. @JetBlue #help
Why we still choose to fly @AmericanAir I will never understand
â€œ@ImJakePaul: Everyone MUST read this! Help us stand up against @united and their poor service!   #DontFlyUnited http://t.co/CxxFXCe1q7â€ðŸ˜’
.@Delta @DeltaAssist has been getting worse but this takes the cake. Can't wait to switch airlines
@DeltaAssist Why is it over a 2 hr wait to speak with an actual person over the phone? A one way flight is costing me more than round trip
@AmericanAir get your act together!! Delayed flights bc of no flight attendants COME ON!! #americanairlines
@united @AmericanAir Guess who just lost a frequent flyier; that spends over $10k per year flying. and who just got a new customer?
@united hates Freedom. And Babies. And puppies.
@DeltaAssist 2 hour call wait for assistance?? Stuck in Tampa trying to go to NYC. No help from delta at all
After a great week of flying. pretty disappointed in @VirginAmerica gate agent at LAX not offering us to pay to get on standby flight. Cont
@AmericanAir Sent my complaint minutes after you suggested the above tweet. Not one response by a human. just 1 automated replay. #SCAM
@united flight ua1728 TPA-IAD extremely delayed. Travelling with small baby. Can you advise on options and also your compensation?
@JetBlue should invest in @Boeing's SSTO aircraft to avoid the 2-3 hour delay that currently plagues flight 428.
Always have the worst time coming to the airport everyone is so rude @AmericanAir
how can my plane leave at 625 p when your own app shows inbound flt landing at 623 p @AmericanAir http://t.co/aM95Czu9qO
Soooo I spent $179 to upgrade and be comfy on my bday flight home... Too bad there's annoying kids bhnd me. ðŸ˜’@VirginAmerica #insanettyBday
@united - really???  missed Gold status by 800 miles and you won't even let me BUY miles to get bumped up?????  What a joke!
.@AmericanAir - not quite sure why I bother to fly w/them: delays &amp; EXTREMELY rude crew. #AmericanAirlines #sucks
Stuck at the airport for 5 hours because @united lost my bags on my layover. Nothing but a "sorry" offered by their man in Jax. Class act.
#UnitedAirlines (@united) pilot makes emergency stop &amp; kicks #child w/ #autism off plane b/c he 'felt uncomfortable' http://t.co/iwoiccMuwj
@AmericanAir after today I will never be flying AA again. You don't deserve any of the relatively small amount of costumers you receive.
@DeltaAssist I was on the queue to be called and then the call was dropped. i put myself back in line but dont want to wait again. pls help
Another .@united #fail Woman Claims She and Daughter With Autism Were Kicked Off #United Airlines Flight https://t.co/Lw5OIV1VB0 via @GMA
As a LOYAL @SouthwestAir customer today has been the worst experience I've ever had traveling. 2 mechanical issues and a canceled flight
Sorry for delay folks. My flight home is cancelled @united so I am trying to see what my options are. Let's resume #courageousconversations
@united I had a first class reservation since Nov. 2014 for a flight from SFO to IAD yesterday.  I got bumped to coach for the B.S. excuse.
â€œ@united: @ughhh182 You can track your claim online at http://t.co/rWEpeuFnzM. ^JPâ€ fuck off
@mtoecker @DeltaAssist @Gogo......abstinence is not the worst goodness ;-))
I will NEVER fly @VirginAmerica again! I booked a flight 6 weeks ago for $227 &amp; today it's only $147. I called + they don't care!
@AmericanAir The passengers of Flt2237 DCA-DFW apologize for annoying your gate &amp; attendants by flying w/ you today. #badservice
@united fuck you
Dear @VirginAmerica they're flight attendants not runway models. Would it kill them to crack a smile or pretend they cared? #underwhelmed
@JohnLHardin Never. EVER. Pick @United. Guaranteed bad time.
@united my family and i waited 8 hours to only find out that our flight was cancelled. Your workers had no idea what to do.
Are you kidding me @united your service is terrible and somehow my brother and I just got bumped from our 12 PM flight to 9 PM WTF is this.
@AmericanAir Lets tell our fellow AA co-workers not to switch or use @sprint . Dishonorable. unethical scammers..
change fee's on @AmericanAir are crazy. never flying with them again!
Terrible customer service from rsw to cll. Wanted to get off at DFW and they tried to charge $200. Now gotta drive back to dfw @AmericanAir
@USAirways @AmericanAir have conspired to ruin our vacation. 3 hrs in broke plane on pls runway. Missed connection. #failed rebooking #fail
As @united pulls another jet from service. staff assure us "we don't just keep $1 million planes waiting around" to stand in. Shame really.
@JetBlue I saw the link is a great opportunity but the problem is that I live in Costa Rica. how do I take advantage of that opportunity?
@JetBlue Not happy abt changes to baggage fees &amp; legroom. Used only Jblue last 2 years. Might be time to look elsewhere  #justlikeothersnow?
@JetBlue Very disappointed. just was charged 75 per ticket lower fare fee  for expensive tickets purchased in March! New policy began in Aug
@AmericanAir   How much longer is my delay???  I wanna see my baby!!!
Your plane broke. now I'm waiting. I'm very disappointed @united
@DrGhaheri @united Disgusting. Gave them a talkin' to. They need to be the ones that are shamed.
It seems like there should be a way to track a lost bag on @united's app. but if there is it's not obvious. #frustrating
@Sejemar @JetBlue that's unacceptable
A big F you to @delta @DeltaAssist for ruining my bag and more importantly my Girl Scout cookies http://t.co/HWQAlS9jj6
@SouthwestAir You people fucking suck and have no idea what the hell you're doing.
@SouthwestAir lost my bag somewhere between PDX and SMF. A short flight and a bright orange bag. How does that happen?
By far the worst flight I have ever been on @AmericanAir - even the pilot referred to the experience as embarrassing. Never again. ðŸ˜¡
@AmericanAir I figured they could've taken care of the maintenance during the 2 hour delay while waiting for a crew...worst airline ever.
Oh @AmericanAir why would you cancel the LAST much delayed flight from DFW to NOLA tonight when there is no availability on Friday??
I hope that one day I'll leave CT and not have an issue with my flight being delayed. @united
Except for the very rude lady at the ticket count my flight was smooth @AmericanAir 👌
@VirginAmerica I was treated very rudely by ur counter agent at Chicago airport. Very disappointed. Will reconsider flying with u again.
Disappointed that @AmericanAir seem to be the only airline not to have a BlackBerry BB10 or compatible Amazon app store app.
worse experience ever @VirginAmerica Orlando tckt counter their lack of interest to assist over 20 people waiting over an hour unbelievable
I will never fly @united again.
Unassigned seats on @SouthwestAir is frustrating when you're 6'6" #exitrowplease
@alaskaair you need to look into the Cargo Dept. In FBX AK. The service is slow and your attendents are rude to customers. 20+ min wait!
Of course @united is doing their own wifi. Increases consumer cost. works worse than @gogo #fail -economy plus &amp; mobile app is saving grace
@united are the worst airline company ever. They are useless in everything they do. Never ever fly with them if possible.
@JetBlue no trip for us. 2 days off work wasted at the airport.
Travel Adventures! Hopefully it won't be like last time. My @united flight is already delayed. That's ok. makes my stay in Chicago shorter!
45 min flight from SFO to LAX. 35min on tarmac @flyLAXairport waiting for gate to open. @AmericanAir i should have driven.
This whole @AmericanAir @USAirways merger is not working out for passengers! #togetherisnotbetter
Anyone thinking of using @AmericanAir: Don't. REPEATEDLY one of the worst experiences I've ever had traveling and offer zero customer care.
Hey @AirCanada been sitting on this muhfuckin runway for an hour. figure your shit out!!! Knew I shoulda stuck with @AlaskaAir
@DeltaAssist all my flying with you and can't get better seat. I'm a SM holder. ask my company to change carrier. EE ALWAYS rude @ airport
.@united hi I have an issue
Worst meal ever @DeltaAssist cold. inedible. roll was best part http://t.co/L7K3nUxeD0
American Airlines sucks-- 2 hour hold time on travel voucher request. terrible customer service.  What's become of @AmericanAir?
I usually swear by @United but this trip was the worst I've ever experienced on any airline. And I fly. A lot.
Let's hope my @AmericanAir flight goes better than it did tonight my flight got delayed one time to many
@Sweetdreamsmma @AmericanAir I know dude. They suck. screwed us up from LA to Edm. Their staff actually got into a fight. #brutalservice
Why can't pre-flight checks be done PRIOR to boarding? Seems like hydraulic faults should be detected earlier. cc: @united
@ImJakePaul @united I promise to never fly United! #DontFlyUnited
Never flying #unitedairlines again everrrr always delayed or cancelled @united
Disappointed that @SouthwestAir wasn't able to help me get a lower fare :(
@AmericanAir my flight got delayed more than 8hours. where can I get a refund?
@iamLAUNCH @united It's not just them. Flying home with @AirCanada this week....yea that was a mess.
@AlaskaAir any chance I can get upgraded to first class since my flight was cancelled out of SFO?
@united got rerouted from @AmericanAir   Rudest ticket agent ever!!!
@united hey i just got onto one of your "vintage" airplanes for a 12 hr flight. you suck one billion dicks. ✌️✌️
Wish I was flying @DeltaAssist #DeltaAirlines now. Instead flying @AmericanAir. Big mistake.  Sad part is tomorrow I'm booked on another AA
@SouthwestAir Never again...I'm so tired of their flight issues. Sitting on the tarmac for going over an hour at LAX on a Fri = FAIL!
@VirginAmerica Two cancelled flights out of Vegas. now you've missed your landing slots for SFO and we wait on. Great safety video though.
I never book anything but @JetBlue when I do the booking. and this trip reminded me why. .@united &amp; @Delta. never again.
@charlieworsham @united is literally the worst.
@AmericanAir for the second week in a row no bags arrived.
@AmericanAir you're gate agents are outwardly annoyed and sarcastic. Tried paying for avail. seat upgrade. left feeling 2nd class.
@sdesserman @united @FlyFrontier Frontier has become the worst! Never flying with them again!
Never flying @SouthwestAir again!!! #angry
GM @DeltaAssist I need help changing my flight. I've been in the wait queue 30 min. Can you assist?
I hate @united. My night from hell started with them. I wasn't supposed to land in the brunt of the storm. Earlier flight was cancelled.
@jetblue gate agent at MCO telling us high winds at JFK delaying flight 484.  Winds are no more that 10mph ?  Real story please? #jetblue
Missed all of our client morning meetings because of 3-hour @AmericanAir flight delays. #timeismoney
Rise n shine.  Let's play some CS.  @Delta or @DeltaAssist you guys should totally get my lost luggage to Milan from JFK. it would be chill.
@AmericanAir After 2 hours on hold and waiting for call backs. I got through today!  7 hrs later. no written confirmation my flight fixed...
@united stuck on a plane in Grand Cayman. So hot in here! Update please?
Last time I'm flying @united . I've never flown out of SLO without a cancellation or delay ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
missed my first flight so I'm missing all of my flights :-) about to become your worst enemy @AmericanAir
This is not how I wanted to start my holidays. @united and @AmericanAir lost both of my bags. Why pay $60 if I wasn't going to get my bags?
If they can put a Spaceship on top of a 747. I am calling bullshit on the overweight bag fee I just paid. @AmericanAir
@shockthomas @SouthwestAir Hate it! I like a guaranteed aisle seat. Not a cattle call with fingers crossed.
@AmericanAir it's not the money. It's the fact that you let people steal and they know nothing happens! Terrible business model.
I have been through hell today with @AmericanAir ... Rude service people. waiting hours on hold and then being hung up on. Kill me please!!
@AmericanAir but you don't provide training to staff in customer service. Entire aa experience unsatisfactory
@united why was my flight from Denver to Newark cancelled from Denver to Newark? I have been waiting on the phone to talk to u for20 minutes
$35 for 2nd checked bag for Gold members. Come on @AmericanAir you're making the switch to @VirginAmerica really easy...
Don't fly @AmericanAir   HORRIBLE customer service. canceled flights. &amp; they steal money. #DontFlyAmerican #AmericanAirSucks
When @united cancels your flight then delays it 3 hours and on top of that the workers here can't pull up the seating map. #horrible
@AmericanAir Do the power outlets on AA's 737-8 ever work? Or am I missing some trick? Everytime I plug in no matter what device I get nada
Already 3 hours delay from #JFK to #MCO @JetBlue @herrkloeppel @MatzenRosen #techtransform
@matthewajacob @AmericanAir  I need to bust from platinum to EP and missing around 30k miles
@SouthwestAir Worst flight ever.  Actually heard a FA ask if a CSA can look up a passenger to confirm he is a celebrity. Awful abuse of pwr
@united seriously what's with the welcoming committee band at EWR? I don't hate it...
Why was I not informed that my bags had to be checked half hour before the ORIGINAL date. regardless of the amount of delays!? @united
@SouthwestAir on hold now 110min - the call back failed 3 times.  This is terrible.  I just want to add my dog to the reservation. DM?
@AmericanAir Overbooked flight &amp; misplaced baggage. Lost a day in Spain. $214 measly compensation. Customer service is nonexistent.
Flying @VirginAmerica is terrible. Is this what flying @SpiritAirPR or @AirTran is like?? Woof.
@SouthwestAir Used to like you. but this is my 2nd flight in a row that has caused me to miss a connection. #stuckindallas #iwannagohome
(2) @DeltaAssist no phone call. no flights. no email response. I need answers. I miss my dogs. Regretting not flying @JetBlue like usual
Aye. @DeltaAssist - 1 hour 29 minute wait to speak to someone?  Medallion needs help here.  Flying to CVG. connect thru LGA...need alt route
@united I hope u treat your human passengers better than your pet passengers. Never using your airline again. #UnitedAirlines #animalcruelty
twice @AmericanAir has delayed tonight's flight back to JFK. starting to wonder if I'm going to be stranded in Toronto...
Just a reminder of how awful @united has been this weekend. You've lost a customer for life. #epicfail http://t.co/UK2SlYaJM1
canceled @united flight. missing priceless graduation ceremony in the morning.  only a $75 credit. shameful !  really @united  !?!??
@AmericanAir @grantlandis they are by far the worst airlines ever
@smheadhunter @VirginAmerica  just don't check your bags!  They will lose it and never follow up. #virginamericadoesntcare
C'mon @jetblue . fog? That's the best excuse you have? Flight #834 tell us the truth
@AmericanAir Your crew and pilots did a horrible job keeping us informed about our delay today #unhappypassenger
@AmericanAir You've had me on hold. bouncing me around to various departments. and after two hours I was abruptly cut off.
â€œ@samipatton1229: @JetBlue why do u hate meâ€
I will never be flying @AmericanAir ever again. 14 hr delay in fare wx. incompetent desk employees. terrible service. Unbelievable...
@united I was delayed more than 3 hours. just on my last trip. and not due to weather. I will DM you my info. but too late for rebooking.
@DeltaAssist my flight number is 1731 Houston to Slc the flight is delayed and ı missed my bus for Jackson Wyoming. Help me!!
WOW. @JetBlue such a disappointment to loyal customers http://t.co/fRouglpARo
So @AmericanAir is the WORST. Trying to get my sis home for my papaw's funeral. The website is faulty + phone agents are "permanently busy"
@JetBlue filght cancelled because of JFK construction. need to rebook. waiting on the phone for over 40 minutes. help!
@VirginAmerica hook me up with that long wait time upgrade! At least a free drink on the flight. I'll take any compensation. Even a hi-5.
5:49am on a Saturday and the line to check my bag at @SouthwestAir is insane. #SFO #travel
@AmericanAir need to see what options I have. On flight AA2290 late out of SLC to DFW. Looks like I will be miss connection AA2244.
@united I chose to fly because it supposed to be faster but with a 3 hr+ delay it would have been faster to drive
@AmericanAir there are no flights from Atlanta to New York? Im trying to fly there before September 8 and I cant find any flights pls help!
ANGRY! Been trying to book a flight on @AmericanAir for TWO WEEKS &amp; I always get this error message. #losingbusiness http://t.co/L7jHAJ2IqF
@DeltaAssist hi! I'm still waiting on the resolution of my email request. :-)

Time for #CPR #DEN #IBP @United #delay
Been on hold with @AmericanAir for almost 2 hours now. #neveragain #ridiculous
@united You need to work on your customer service. Its not expectable to leave an elderly lady w/o assistance in a wheelchair.#disapointed
@united first you delay me now you cancel me. can't wait to see what's next
@AmericanAir have literally been on hold for 40 minutes. I have things I want to do tonight---can you help me?
Taxing on the Tarmac at LAX. @SouthwestAir wants to further torture us by blasting hideous music through their crappy speakers!
@saharali2909 @AmericanAir Really? Sahar has been waiting over 2 months for a response from you! #thatsnotcool
I'd rather eat my own face than fly with @AmericanAir again. Worst people. no help.
Disappointed in @AmericanAir today. Taking parents on 40th anniv trip to europe biz class. Got aa bc they said wed be in new plane. Nope! :(
@tcrawford @united that's worse than the tow bar breaking or tug blowing a tire
Seems like im not the only one that has terrible experiences with @AmericanAir and they never do s***t about it #theyloseluggage
@Delta screwed me out of MORE than half of my recent miles flown-- will now RE-BOOK all bus travel AWAY from @Delta to @AlaskaAir or others.
.@DeltaAssist 4 out of our 7 people do not have their bags with no idea when we will. Not okay with that!
@AmericanAir you putting me in troubles with flight AA215 delay from March 01 at 7:45PM to March 02 at 10:30AM.
@DeltaAssist @CADavebert Ditto on login problems here...
Ugh I've been on hold for 26 minutes trying to make a reservation @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir @JetBlue waived fees for those regions. Why can't American? http://t.co/HzK2bBdn8y I'm just a little sad
Always can count on @delta to fail you. 1.5 hour delay out of CID. now stuck in MS (missed connection). Never again @DeltaAssist
Not impressed with a rebooking experience I had with @AmericanAir today due to cxld flights and missed connections. Reconsidering loyalty.
@JetBlue Can you help with check-in process for @AHessCA? Having issues online
I hate waiting to see who's going to ask for the middle seat on @SouthwestAir flights. It's like waiting to be picked for gym class
@Delta @SkyWestAirlines @SouthwestAir Please stop taking $ for #geoengineering. You're killing the planet. https://t.co/KVelxX056V
@SouthwestAir how can you make people stay in the airport when you couldn't wait 20 minutes for the other plane?? Please help.
@AskAmex great!  Just to confirm my @JetBlue has foreign transaction fees but Delta Gold does not?  Sounds like I may be switching!
@DeltaAssist just sent a DM need to connect my SM to a NYC flt I can't make it work! 1hr wait on phone with delta!
@Rich_Crawford6 @VirginAmerica you wanna be Iggy azalea so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
@AmericanAir trying to reschedule a cancelled stopover but there's no one at support. Who do I talk to?
@SouthwestAir - ridiculous policy. Full fare for the CHANCE to fly earlier. Never again! #DontFlySWA http://t.co/hz4ScxEgA6
@AirlineFlyer @AmericanAir I can never view new Arrivals issues on their first day.  I always get "Object not found. (WWC-50003)".
Sunday night. ORD-DEN. Late again. Prolly gonna miss my connection. @united . something's gotta give! Please. we (passengers) have lives!
And another horrible @USAirways @AmericanAir experience...
@AmericanAir #12 on the upgrade list. Maybe I have a shot today on my flight!!!!😂Oh wait I'm only platinum....
@DeltaAssist never thought I'd say this - DAL skypriority bag check nightmare this AM at JFK may convert me to @united or @JetBlue #bteam
@AmericanAir @ML2Gooner  bad service  yesterday  y fly dallas to hong kong and fligth its delayed  10 hrs and my bagage   not comes
@chase0409 @AmericanAir Yeah. because you're upset. throw out all logic that delays can be variety of reasons. assume whole company is shit!
@AmericanAir why'd y'all Fuck up on my boy Christian smh
Crying son gets pregnant @SarahBlackwood1 kicked off @united @SkyWestAirlines even after the child had fallen asleep http://t.co/pSiNg4Vstp
@AmericanAir I have it. It was very slow baggage handling at the airport.
@budge_uk @DeltaAssist @Delta Please tell me it wasn't because of the storm. That's worse than leaves on a train line! #weather #airport
@AlaskaAir had to wait a couple hours for the next flight.
@SouthwestAir disappointed to see a flight attendant berate a young mother on flight 893
@AmericanAir I would've thought that was the case when asking for a refund but just had more problems
@kimberlybogle I avoid @AmericanAir at all costs. 7/8 of my flights have had issues. I'll pay more before losing more time.
To date. flying @united was the most horrible experience I have ever had especially flying with my toddler. #worstserviceever
@SouthwestAir set up Twitter to let u know how bad ur service is. 2 hour delay 4 crew change. Terrible experience.
Oh. @united! How did you know I woke up today &amp; said. "man. I wish I could get delayed just long enough to watch my connection fly away"?
Something stuck inside the xray machine and chaos ensues while staff stares and does nothing. @americanair #failing http://t.co/I3ovhrGDRe
@united get your act together.  Weight balancing software crash has us waiting and waiting
I'm gonna have to write a letter to @AmericanAir. It was the worst airline service I have ever experienced.
Delta flight cancelled. Impossible to get a hold of a live person. Very disappointed @Delta @DeltaAssist
@JeromeASF @united Delta and United are just awful. They really can be that dumb?
Horrible call hold time 1hr &amp; 45 min with @SouthwestAir to fix a mistake on my reservation &amp; no apology for the extended hold
By the end of month my visited states map look like this &amp; I'm furious that @united RUINED it by canceling Georgia http://t.co/O8RK1Pfinc
I want to go to San Francisco really bad. Time to look at some flight on @AlaskaAir.
United airlines screwed us over.  Delayed our flight now we missed the connecting flight home. Won't give us the next flight back @united
Hey @united. maybe if a flight is delayed you make and announcement or put it on one of the monitors instead of not saying anything at all.
It's wrong when all an airline will say is 'sorry 4 maintenance &amp; weather'. 6 hr delay STL to EWR @united. no bad weather at all today
@united flight 1628 continues to be an awful experience. Delayed. direct tv didn't work. landed at 7:15. still waiting for bags in bag claim
2 hour 20 min delay... @AmericanAir you're killing me. At least I have no where to be tonight 👌
@AmericanAir My wife is on Flight3130 from Chicago to Oklahoma. and they've been waiting on the Tarmac for 3 hours!  #Fail
@SouthwestAir media partners angry passengers at gate c6 in Phx as they just cancelled flight to Chicago; their saying no flts until Tuesday
.@SouthwestAir still waiting on that resolution... DM &amp; email seem to not be working?
If you ever feel like wasting 5 hours of your life (and your money). fly @united! One of the worst travel experiences I've had to date.
@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is late. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
@AmericanAir Boarded a massive full flight ahead of schedule from LGA to Chicago and departed on time no problem. 👍🏼#AA1472
Flight to chicago was delayed so we may miss our flight from Chicago to Brussels gg @united
So disappointed in my @united flight experience. Lost luggage. terrible customer service. and a cracked laptop screen.
Double rainbow with one side ending on our broken plane. Delayed at least another hour for maintenance @SouthwestAir http://t.co/me2R34Lig9
@DeltaAssist I have been re-seated after check in without my consent or notification. Very unhappy. Expecting a fix.
@AmericanAir waiting to park at our gate...#Delayed
Passengers stuck for a 9 hour delay for a 30 minute flight?! Cruel. @AmericanAir http://t.co/qyc9telSZe
Non-perk perk @AmericanAir charge for bags. then comp. them if you spend on their ridiculous card. http://t.co/pXyXrVrgt0
Hi @AmericanAir . I'm still waiting an answer to my  request: 1-3409216321 . You can read in my blog with #AAdelay http://t.co/3jkB4NEISC

@AmericanAir I need to cancel a flight I booked today - I've been on hold almost 3 hours! Ridiculous! http://t.co/jBGm5WxzBz
On one side I had chatty 76 YO Barbara. on other side I had stinky guy that I never want to smell again.  Notes from my flight with @united
@Delta @DeltaAssist this is ridiculous
@DeltaAssist it has taken you 4 months to respond to my complaint and then you don't even answer my questions! Awful customer care.
@united I'm disappointed. Why is it that the front of the plane gets dibs on food? Can't you carry enough on a 6 hour flight? #unitedsucks
1st time ever &amp; last time I will ever travel with @united been on hold 21 Minutes waiting for a manager because your reps are not very smart
May never fly @united again after the treatment at gate D14 @Dulles_Airport yesterday flight UA3761 ... Terrible gate attendant
.@SouthwestAir delayed flight 2 Chicago. which leads to me running around the entire DMV area to get to my bags. #ThisDayHasBeen2Long
Having the worst experience with @united. I understand weather but making us run back and forth over 5 times between gates is ridiculous.
Had similar issues with @united b4 - they'll never learn and I'll never fly with them again!  #unitedfortahera http://t.co/4i0IgfkrcS
@JetBlue oh wait! @Delta now cancelled as well.
@jamiewit RT @chrisdelia .@united come fly with us! Fuck you shitheads. This is who runs your company. Cats. http://t.co/Ih4WntAusa
@united @kristen I am sorry they#united are only disappointed!
@AmericanAir @tdrakeeee has waited 2 hours 2 get assistance. How long does it take? I'm an advantage member /her father. Please answer
Ok @DeltaAssist. 35 mins on hold to change a SkyMiles ticket due to weather. Any help?
Can someone at @VirginAmerica please contact me about a damaged baggage claim? #Thanks
@JetBlue Flight 305 from EWR to FLL. I don't mind the flight delay. but NONE OF THE IN FLIGHT TVS ARE WORKING???
1st flight ever on @VirginAmerica &amp; already a prob. Called Virgin &amp; they won't rebook me w/o a fee...even though flight delay is their fault
@JetBlue Hello. Do you do customer service here? We had two cabs let us down. running late. can't check in via app or site. no call answer.
Will never fly @AmericanAir again!! Will be making a formal complaint in the am! Gave my seats away and it was their fault we were late. #BS
@AmericanAir @SURFER_Magazine Got to my hotel and found it like this. Paid $150 for bringing it. You said you'd pay for damages. Will you?
@united unacceptable bag delays at LAX coupled w Baggage Resolution Reps unable/unwilling to process refunds of bag fees - I will not fly UA
@DeltaAssist so you cancel a flight from CHS to ATL at 2am today then have nobody at the counter to help an entire plane full of people?
@united are maintenance issues out of your control? I sure hope not. San Diego to Denver on Monday at 330 and then Chicago to bwi
@AlaskaAir I waited about 30 min for my bags from SLC to SFO this morning
"That's the reason I fly Southwest because American Airlines is my American Horror Story" -my mother @SouthwestAir
@DeltaAssist mum is on DL401 and text me telling me about a delay due to a mechanical error. is it fixed/have they taken off?
@united hate the new boarding system. Take way more time. Folks w/ suitcases stuck in back of plane w/ line of folks behind
@AmericanAir second plane in a week stuck at the gate with mech probs. passing up @united as having the worst planes. Ever.
@AmericanAir better late than never.
@SouthwestAir Lots of angry customers. Flight to FL delayed over three hours. returning to gate because of a crew change. No ETA. Wtf??
Button mashing check-in for your @SouthwestAir flight sometimes does work. A31 boarding is not bad...

wow having the worst customer experience of my life with @VirginAmerica literally not a soul can help me find a lost item...
@united hate this delay!! Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir utterly disappointed in your airline. I can say with out a doubt that I will never fly with you again!
@AmericanAir just put all 250+ passengers on the plane to Hong Kong and then turned around and canceled the flight after a 10 hour delay.
@AmericanAir stuck on dfw Tarmac on intl flight with only minutes to clear customs and transfer. Orig had 3 hours layover but u moved us
@united You suck. A minor incident with an autistic girl over a meal and you people divert the plane and have the family taken off? You Suck
@AlaskaAir flight 767 stops in Spokane. "Low fuel" was 1st reason. "Broken fuel gauge" was 2nd reason. #dontknowwhattobelieve

@DeltaAssist My luggage was broken into by handlers at DTW on 9/9 &amp; irreparably damaged I sent a complaint &amp; have heard nothing.
Hmm. Why didn't @united let me know my flight was delayed 2 hrs? I gave up my seat at the bar &amp; some beer. Did Dallas score?

.@SouthwestAir please help @wheelieboy with his wheelchair problem.
@united 1.5 hr wait for luggage Simply ridiculous. Get ur act together.
