128833,@JetBlue. just a suggestion. Don't put a 2h45 minute movie on a 2h20 flight. Appreciate the movies. not pleasant missing the end.

16953,@southwestair flying on 10/15 from clt to pdx with layover in mdw. Should we expect issues from the FAA fire mess?
16954,@JetBlue I'm In airplane to Fort launderdale and may miss next flight to austin due to this plane delay. how it works?
16955,@HEELZiggler @TripleH @united I think it's @mikethemiz' fault. He probably stole your bag.
16956,I booked with @united over a cheaper airline for the customer service.  Very disappointed thus far.
16957,@bueb61 @bgwinGK @united It's the worse airline in the country..and they simply don't care that they are a mess.
16958,@VirginAmerica gave me absolutely nothing for being stranded on the Tarmac for several hours. @JetBlue issued flight credits.

16970,@WNSource @HEELZiggler @VinceMcMahon how about @united is full of fuck-ups and they lost his luggage. continuing their hatred of wrestlers.

16973,Surprise! The boarding process on @USAirways is just as bad as it is on @AmericanAir  why do I continue to fly with these fools?
16974,@united but wait. We aren't even at IAH. we are hobby. And I can't get off because of what???
16975,@united was not me that needed help. it was everyone else on the plane who missed their flights because of the two mechanical delays.
16976,So @united lost @HEELZiggler's Intercontinental Title. Did they try looking in the 8:30 segment? We usually leave it there #RAWTonight

162515,I haven't been home in a year &amp; the @AmericanAir 5:30pm flight to DFW from EVV is no longer an option :-(
56725,@united it happened between last night and today so technically. yes. that's the past. And the woman I called on the Platinum line was rude.

57997,No TVs. no free WiFi. no unlimited snacks? @AmericanAir kills me. I miss @JetBlue 
46076,@SouthwestAir can my flight from DTW to LGA be switched from DTW to BDL? I would just stay on 697...

40935,It feels like gambling when I check into my @SouthwestAir flight. You never know what you get until you click. results are unpredictable.

144241,Instead of listening what experts like @Sidragon1 say ab aircraft security. @united kicks him off flight http://t.co/8mJfkQ8zLf. Real smart
135403,@united I can't believe after this nightmare of a day you guys leave all of our gear in Chicago.
22407,@DeltaAssist we missed our layovers because of crew delays and we will arrive late to Warsaw and miss our ferry to Helsinki.
15913,@LM_Burt @united this is sarcasm of course. You need to stop the ignorant tweets
82913,@SouthwestAir If I miss my flight from Atl to Jax its your fault... I land in Atl at 2:30 boarding the plane in Atl at 2:35 ...
28665,@DeltaAssist any chance you could delay my flight back to London so I can watch the new of game 7...

1062,@united No. I was on flight UA1709 from Seattle to DC (Dulles) leaving at 10:17PM. She was the Asian lady serving gate A5. Extremely rude.
120156,@SouthwestAir your new logo is worse than what you had before. You should really back charge the designer and bring back the old one
30506,Missed lunch. Stuck in my office on conf calls. Rummaged through backpack. found this. @SouthwestAir to the rescue!_ http://t.co/tfuVIjqS9s

107256,@usairways @AmericanAir So my flights were cancelled on Friday and Saturday now my husband is stranded and you guys still arent taking calls
36948,I have less and less patience for airlines the more I travel. Stuck in Kansas City until @SouthwestAir can get their act together.

52183,Tip: Never ask to have a FRAGILE sticker on your bags when flying with @JetBlue. crew-members will just bump it and hit it more than usual.

54322,@americanair I left @southwestair 1 yr ago because of bad service like this. I'm starting to wonder if I should go back or maybe to @delta?

58874,.@SouthwestAir can your New Years resolution please be to actually leave on time? http://t.co/kjxM82iClN
99043,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
20382,@united this is the problem with automated messages :D see full conversation. please ;)
13547,@SouthwestAir I was TOTALLY unaware of your NEW policy stating that if you don't cancel a flight. you no longer get your CREDIT! Lost $300
35738,@JetBlue about to take off from JFK to SFO. Just found out the tv's and wifi aren't working :( HUGE disappointment.
119104,@SouthwestAir I cheated on you with Delta. Sorry. can you forgive me? may I ride in your roomy. non arrogant planes again?!
62888,@SpiritAirlines it only took one semi upset tweet to @SouthwestAir for me to get an apology.. You guys are seriously slacking
43293,@DeltaAssist Is it Delta policy to cancel the whole trip if one leg is cancelled?
34557,@united what's the issue in SFO.  It says there is a an ATC delay there.All flights say they're on time. Flying out of YEG. What's the issue
137511,@SouthwestAir what's the holdup with flight#1730? Still waiting to board. Worried I'll miss my connection. Blue skies here in PIT?!?!
49257,@AlaskaAir @makeandtakes Would end too quickly. Most of those things you can find at the gate. :) Oh wait. for kids? Make an adult version!
159321,@united gave out $100 credit or 5k miles for putting up with the rough day stuck at the airport. #EffortAppriciated

133669,@united take your time and bring the replacement part/plane here in Kona. I'd rather wait longer than flying to Honolulu to get it ?!

30661,Wait I'm legit dancing to1989 and the guy next to me is sleeping help @united

51034,I have to say. @united staff deserve credit for keeping us updated on the mulitple issues delaying flight 5339
150425,@AmericanAir $1100 to ship a rescued dog from BZE to DFW?  United only charges $200-300.  Insane.  Just wrong.

133376,Boy sitting here for any longer than 5 minutes would suck. @SouthwestAir #Travel #NoSeat4U https://t.co/u9l1mPJzQV
133377,I've come to the unavoidable conclusion that airlines only maintain their aircraft while sitting on the tarmac. @AmericanAir
133378,@AmericanAir she's obviously still a little sad over the UK loss to UW last night 
133379,Still here. @Delta @DeltaAssist way to drop the ball. 3 hours after I was supposed to depart. I'm still here. Never flying with you again.
133380,Stellar fucking customer service @united http://t.co/iiUYOmHGdw
133381,@DeltaAssist too late. Already boarding and full flight.
133382,_@bobbyrazak: Drama in the skies @united the co-pilot passes out. http://t.co/ldM6KtXnbE_  Hate it when that happens..
133383,@AmericanAir but too bad the flight will be cancelled due to laziness on AA's part
133384,@AmericanAir so my flight is over an hour late. yet I was never told of a delay. and it still shows on time. Wasting my time.
133385,Please explain what the hell is going on with flight 3360 @united

133390,Bring Xone 5 for boarding with @united sucks. At least I'm only one flight away from where I need to be.
133391,@mkleef @AlaskaAir @Delta I've switched and NEVER looked back. Points from international partners still count towards status.
133392,So I had to pay for a new flight this morning bc I missed mine. Now this flight is late!! @AmericanAir can I get some money back!!
133394,@Delta. @DeltaAssist 12hr to get home. still no luggage. you knew JFK has construction and flights delay. no comunication. shame on u
133395,@united There's no gate agents on the plane. We're just waiting. past the reported departure time. I already missed my connecting flight.
133396,@SouthwestAir you guys have to do better. It's been 2hrs. &amp; we're still sitting on the plane waiting to take off.

133402,Wahoooo all sorted @AmericanAir cannot wait @KevOHanlon94 http://t.co/33KIu6ry0z
133403,@united Epic fail. Sitting on Tarmac after arriving  @sfo for 30mins bc another plane is currently in our spot"". Figure it out!"

108971,@SouthwestAir So Sad. Waited so long for Aug to open from BWI-AUA to find only Saturdays open after the 8th. Why ? More days open when?
79710,@united One of our luggage has been missing for over 2 weeks now. Our trip is over and we are going back home. Any chance to see it again?

20397,@SouthwestAir it's more than inconvenience it's indifference. You aren't UA or Delta
43737,@AmericanAir The least number of customers affected isn__t a comforting metric for a plane that only carries 102 passengers.  la 321T. Sigh.
13004,@united just got back from SFO. Unbelievably bad service at the airport with the automated check ins. Stay clear if you value your sanity!
61012,MT @tyfrancis: Awful #customerfail news as @united leaves a dog on the runway and responds to a tweet with this. Sigh http://t.co/SHzZUh2ftb

77905,.@United rebanking coming to ORD in Q1 '15; completed in late '14 for IAH and DEN. Increased yields as a result.
