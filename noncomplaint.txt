@AirlineFlyer does @JetBlue have the option to listen to live ATC throughout the flight? Cause if so... You really will be missing out
@AlaskaAir fantastic! Thanks for doing that. I'm not mad at your cheese platter. but sometimes I want a hot sandwich option for dinner.

@JetBlue in classic Jet Blue fun style they announce the arrival of a delayed flight with Rocky theme song. Great way to bring smiles.
Thanks @VirginAmerica for having TVs (and #vodka). I'd be crying if I missed the #SFGiants game.  GO GIANTS!
@JetBlue thanks for making a delayed flight back to being on schedule. Always my fav airline!

Despite a hell of a snow yesterday. flight is still leaving on time. Cheers to @Reagan_Airport  and @JetBlue
Feel like the pilot has a little bit of badass when he's wearing cowboy boots with his uniform... two thumbs up  @DeltaAssist.
@jerrycferrara @SouthwestAir out of Cleveland Hopkins is where it's at! Never any problems for me and I fly a lot out of here.
We had some bad turbulence on a flight from Boston to BWI last week and @SouthwestAir gave my wife and I each $150 vouchers. Not bad.
Epic performance by Logan Airport. @TSA and @JetBlue this morning. Barely broke stride thru security. #happyfriday
@DeltaAssist hi! Trying to book a flight via call as I've got a credit with you from a earlier cancelled flight. Any way I can do it myself?
@DeltaAssist @Delta my friend is on her first intl trip. Her wallet was stolen an they won't let her board without the credit card! HELP!
Nice of @JetBlue to cancel my return trip too. Wouldn't want to have to just find one new flight.
It's sad to see the @AlaskaAir mileage balance at 0 for the new year. but the MVP Gold next to my name for 12 more months sure is worth it!
The snow is really making me miss my @united Global First Suite._ http://t.co/PtOCpzHwuV

@VirginAmerica heya! I like lots of what you offer. However. your partner @Gogo's practice of making it very difficult to cancel isn't cool.
Sad to hear about the @JetBlue "improvements." You WERE the best. #dontgivein
@camerondallas @AmericanAir can I come too? I wanna travel! It's Friday! Duh wait for me I'll pack my suitcase!

Now that's how you do a 9/11 tweet. RT @AmericanAir: Today. we pause to remember those we lost. They will forever be in our hearts.
@JetBlue thank you - was incredibly easy to switch to an earlier flight on Sat. Fingers crossed it leaves on time!
@VirginAmerica Hey! Looking for the link on your website for claiming missing miles. Can you please help me find it? Thanks!

I haven't flown @JetBlue in ages &amp; forgot how much better of an experience it is. And this on an otherwise crappy trip. so I appreciate it.
@JeriBordelon @VirginAmerica Yay! Come back to see us soon! We already miss you! #DAL #LUV

We cannot wait for the new flights between #Newcastle and #NewYork! So pleased @united are starting them soon
.@Delta @JetBlue @VirginAmerica @united would any of you be willing to match my current @AmericanAir status? If so. I'll happily switch.
@united pretty sure @AlaskaAir would love responded by now... Sigh.
@SouthwestAir will flights into Nashville tomorrow morning still be cancelled?
My @united flight this pm has wi-fi. Squee!   My EA: Must be one of those fancy @Airbus planes  He lets me geek out without shame. #PaxEx
@AlaskaAir gate attendant running delayed AS461 flt out of SEA to BLI at gate D3 is great. promote that guy.
So far. staying with SkyTeam and @KLM / @DeltaAssist seems faaaar preferable to switching over to StarAlliance and @Lufthansa / @Austrian.
Wow RT @CNNMoney: .@JetBlue offering to fly police to NYC for funerals of 2 #NYPD officers killed last weekend http://t.co/Q8HGLRq2Lb
"@GerryDick: MORE NONSTOPS: @SouthwestAir announcement @IIB #IIB" More west coast yes .still miss ATA in INDY

@AlaskaAir There was a tiny delay as the flight crew waited for lighting to stop before takeoff in New Mexico.
@VirginAmerica first class meals are so much better than @Amtrak first class dining. Amtrak should be ashamed.. never used to be like that.
@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually. As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
@Tommy19smith @PaigeTraquair @AmericanAir That's shocking. hope nothing was missing. Xx
So @deltaassist already offered to help even though they are not at fault. Thanks @delta. @alaskaair could take lessons.
@AmericanAir SCREW YOU @jeromejarre justwantstomake someoneday a little bit brighter and bringa smileto theirface. #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT
Hey @AlaskaAir a trip to Arizona this weekend sure would be nice I'd love to see my hawks kick some Cardinal butt! #gohawks #SEAvsAZ

Gonna switch my allegiance to @united from @AmericanAir.
@TheFoodLab @VirginAmerica Oh my. I'm thinking it's not a good idea for him to be putting MORE gas into his body. Gas in = gas out.
Flying @VirginAmerica is always less stressful &amp; more fun. Mood lighting works on me. I guess. Beautiful day to fly! http://t.co/hb2Iqj0i44
Very impressed w/ @AmericanAir. Tweeted them from the air about a delayed flight and their social media team took care of rebooking conxion.
@adventuresofjon @united so I've heard! Makes me sad because my experiences until now have been great (just luck?) I miss @JetBlue.
Noting like getting to the airport to find out ur flight's been cancelled!!! thanks @AmericanAir where was my email.
@united Do you serve them with breakfast? I'm LHR-bound tomorrow night. so mine will be a delayed celebration!
@united am I going to miss my connection in Houston?
.@AlaskaAir Thanks for bringing #TBT to television. Love seeing those old commercials! Some things (like you) never change.
Thanks @JetBlue for upgrading me to #Mint after I got super late to the airport! Being late is good sometimes! LOL! #Mosaic loving jetBlue!
@AlaskaAir it was a great flight. thanks! I'm rarely dissatisfied when I fly with Alaska. so another thanks! :)
S/O to @AmericanAir for making me miss my flight!
Never appreciated @JetBlue so much until I had to experience another airline
@mattgutmanABC wow Matt tis the season ! @JetBlue  stressed me out on both legs of my trip this week
@AlaskaAir @strongvscancer @DangeRussWilson This is awesome! I can't wait to fly y'all later this week with my family. GO HAWKS!
@AlaskaAir Kendra at PDX was AWESOME and got me home. I've never had a bad experience with AlaskaAir.

@JensenAckles @AmericanAir  It will be worth the wait to see your baby girl!! Wait what?? It's snowing? It's a -10 here in Iowa!
@jetblue stranding a group of college students in NC? WTF? It's BS that you are telling them no flights to JFK in the next two days.
many thanks to @AlaskaAir and @flypdx for retrieving my lost notebook in minutes!
@AlaskaAir thanks! It could be worse. I guess.
@PanAmBag Especially if @AlaskaAir kicks it off with some great promo fares!
@JetBlue Thank you so much for making my experience as a person w/health issues so pleasant!
Upgraded my whole team to 1st class &amp; main cabin select! Best way to deal with a delay. Free movies &amp; food. Strategy. @VirginAmerica

Last meal with mom before I dodge this #blizzardof2015 @JetBlue thanks for letting me switch my flight to an earlier one today! _
@darksecretplace @AlaskaAir @TheBryanSuits Looks like 3F can afford to miss a meal or two!
Grew up eating @AlaskaAir meals. set the bar pretty high. Flying other airlines was a real let-down. Miss free meals in coach though.
@jonisick So why not switch from @AmericanAir to @United or @Delta? (The question answers itself. of course. Still better than @ryanair.)
@LeeRadziwill @SouthwestAir  I used to think so. too. It would suck to attend a festival where they only served peanuts.
Shout out to @AmericanAir attendant John on flight 2476 from BDL to MIA for exceptional customer service to kick start our honeymoon!

@VirginAmerica If I had paid for Main Cabin Select. I'd be particularly upset.
I switched to @VirginAmerica to their Gold level FF program. Why dont you issue brding passes for all legs of a trip when departing 1st leg?
@united from the back of the bus towards the front. Global upgrade came through. Let's work on UA6 from NRT 2 IAH. Can't wait to get home!
.@SouthwestAir guess which road warrior reached companion pass status - this one did! Can't wait to take advantage of this fab perk!

HOU-BZE flights. Can't wait for that to happen on @SouthwestAir
@JetBlue thanks! Should we go to the airport for the original flight time or is it safe to assume the late departure?
Had a blast with Gale and Naina from Burbank to Denver @SouthwestAir I'm a fearful flyer but made me feel I can conquer this fear. Flt 2523
@paultowntwo @omarsuleiman504 @christocarbone @united that anyone believes this actually happened should destroy anyone's faith in democracy
